  3 familiarises the user with the cleaning processes that follow the etching 
  and texturing of the silicon.  The HF treatment removes any thin oxide layers 
  that may have formed on the silicon and more importantly, any residual sodium 
  silicate that may remain on the surface.  This treatment is followed by a rinsing 
  process and then a treatment in <span
class=SpellE>HCl</span> to remove any metal atoms that would otherwise potentially 
  damage the minority carrier diffusion lengths following high temperature exposure. 
  The processing variables to be user specified for each acid treatment are the 
  concentration of the acid, the length of time the wafers are left in the acid 
  and the subsequent rinsing time in high purity water. All other processing parameters 
  for all other processes throughout the production line remain fixed at the default 
  values and therefore cannot be varied for this assignment.</font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The assignment 
  batch contains 10 wafers. You may process as many batches as you like while 
  trying to optimise the processing parameters of the &#147;acid clean&#147;.  Your overall 
  aim is to achieve the highest performance cells but while simultaneously achieving 
  good yields.  There are <b>help files</b> that can be accessed to help you understand 
  and learn about the significance of these cleaning parameters and their optimisation.  
  There are also various tests you can perform on finished and partially finished 
  cells to help monitor performed during processing. You may process multiple 
  &#147;Assignment batches&#147;, in order to achieve the best possible results.  You will 
  submit the results from one batch to satisfy task A and may submit the results 
  from a separate batch to satisfy the requirements of Task B.   Often in manufacturing, 
  we find that the batch that produces the highest efficiency cell (as required 
  for task A), does not necessarily produce the highest average cell efficiency 
  for the whole batch (as required for task B).  Each task is worth 50% of the 
  marks, with the efficiencies achieved directly determining the marks awarded:</font></p>
