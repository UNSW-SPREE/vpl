<h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sheet Resistivity Measurement</font></h4>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
  four-point probe tester is shown in the figure below. It is able to measure 
  the sheet resistivity of a layer of semiconductor material.  The sheet resistivity 
  is defined as being the resistivity of the material divided by the thickness 
  of the layer being measured.  For example, a 1 ohm cm resistivity wafer that 
  is 330 microns thick will have a sheet resistivity of 30 ohms per square.  </font></p>

  <i> Figure:  4-point probe tester for measuring the sheet resistivity of a layer</i></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To 
  make measurements, the four in line probes are brought into contact with the 
  surface of the layer whose sheet resistivity is to be measured.  The outer two 
  probes then feed a specific current into the layer being measured while the 
  central two probes measure the voltage difference that appears between those 
  two corresponding points on the layer surface.  The lower the sheet resistivity, 
  the higher the conductivity and hence the lower the voltage being formed between 
  these inner two probes.  A simple mathematical expression can be derived that 
  relates to the geometry of these probes and facilitates the calculation of the 
  sheet resistivity directly as a function of the voltage measured between the 
  inner two probes (for a given current flowing between the outer two probes).  
  </font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
  test is particularly useful following the formation of the emitter through phosphorus 
  diffusion.  It gives a direct measure as to the sheet resistivity of this emitter 
  and therefore the corresponding resistive losses to be expected in finished 
  devices resulting from the lateral flow of collected carriers within this layer 
  that must travel to the silver metal contact to flow from the device. It is 
  also a direct measure of the amount of phosphorus that has been diffused within 
  the emitter.  What this test does not measure, however, is the difference in 
  doping profile that may exist between two samples that have the same sheet resistivity.  
  For example, it is possible to have a sheet resistivity of 30 ohms/square using 
  a very heavily phosphorus doped layer that is only a fraction of a micron thick.  
  In comparison, it is also possible to achieve a sheet resistivity of 30 ohms/square 
  using a substantially lower phosphorus doping concentration provided the thickness 
  of the layer is quite a bit greater.</font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
  preparation for this test, it is often necessary to remove the diffusion oxide 
  chemically to facilitate good contact between the four probes and the silicon 
  surface.  With textured surfaces, it may be possible to make these measurements 
  without removing the diffusion oxide due to the relative ease of contacting 
  the points of the pyramids.  Caution, however, needs to be exercised as excessive 
  pressure can lead to damage to the pyramid peaks or just as importantly, contamination 
  of the pyramid peaks from the metal comprising the probe tester (usually osmium). 
  In an undiffused wafer, this test can be used to measure the sheet resistivity 
  of the wafer itself.  When this value is multiplied by the thickness of the 
  wafer, the resistivity of the wafer material can be determined.  When the surface 
  of the wafer is diffused with dopants of the opposite polarity to the substrate 
  material, the current from the probes is confined to the surface region by the 
  semiconductor junction.  It is therefore just the sheet resistivity of the diffused 
  surface (normally the emitter) that is determined and in most cases this is 
  unaffected by the underlying substrate doping.</font></p>
