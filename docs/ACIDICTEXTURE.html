  texturing is routinely used in industry for the texturing of mono-crystalline
  silicon wafers. However it is not well suited to the texturing of multi-crystalline
  silicon wafers because the variation in crystal orientation at the surface of
  multi-crystalline wafers can result in large non-textured and hence
  highly-reflective regions. Recall alkaline etching is anisotropic and etches
  the {100} planes much faster than the {111} planes therefore any grains which
  have exposed {111} planes will be etched significantly less than any exposed
  {100} planes. Furthermore, excessive etching can occur at the grain
  boundaries resulting in surfaces that are subject to different emitter
  formation and preferred sites for impurities and therefore are difficult to
  passivate. For these reasons, multi-crystalline wafers are routinely textured
  using acidic solutions containing hydrofluoric acid (HF) and nitric acid (HNO</span><sub><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>3</span></sub><span
  style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>) in water. These solutions etch all
  silicon crystal planes at approximately the same rate and so are called
  isotropic etchants. The HNO</span><sub><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>3</span></sub><span style='font-family:
  "Arial","sans-serif"'> oxidises the silicon surface and then the HF
  solubilises, or dissolves, the oxidised silicon. Mono-crystalline wafers can
  also be textured using acidic texturing however most manufacturers select not
  to do so as a lower average reflectance can be achieved using alkaline
  texturing for these wafers.</span></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>After wire
  sawing, the surface of a silicon wafer is not very uniform and typically has
  many rough features on the surface called saw marks. The slurry used in wire
  saw process contains silicon carbide particles which are much harder than
  silicon and therefore cut through the brick during wafering process. The
  silicon carbide particles cause distortion and defects in the silicon lattice
  at the cut surface making that surface very reactive. Acidic texturing
  depends on this damage which is caused during the wire sawing process. Unlike
  alkaline texturing where the use of anisotropic etching is responsible for
  the texturing, in acid texturing the texturing results from isotropic etching
  being initiated at defect sites on the surface. Consequently, acidic texturing
  will depend critically on the pre-clean process (i.e., the cleaning performed
  after wire-sawing). It is very important that the wire-saw damage is not
  removed before the start of the acidic texturing process. In fact, if you
  were to saw-damage etch wafers before acidic texturing, then the etching rate
  would be much decreased and the reflectance higher. </span></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>The etching

  style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>). The NO<sub>2</sub> is attracted
  to cathodic sites on the silicon (i.e., where there is a slightly negative
  charge) and there it accepts electrons from the silicon lattice. This
  chemical reduction reaction can also be viewed as one that creates holes in
  the silicon. The resulting NO</span><sub><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>2</span></sub><sup><span style='font-size:

  style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>+</span></sup><span
  style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>) in the etching bath to regenerate
  nitrous acid (HNO</span><sub><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>2</span></sub><span

  generation of NO</span><sub><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>2</span></sub><span
  style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>.&nbsp; This aspect of the silicon
  oxidation results in autocatalytic etching. In other words, with increased
  etching the concentration of HNO<sub>2</sub> increases causing an increase in
  the rate of the etching reaction. The etching rate is further increased with
  time due to the exothermic nature of the reactions involved. The increased
  local heating results in an increased rate of diffusion of the reactants to
  the reaction site and an increased reaction rate. If the temperature of the
  bath is reduced, the diffusion of reactants to the surface and reaction
  products from the surface can be slowed. The autocatalytic and exothermic
  properties of the etching reaction can be used to advantage to reduce the
  diffusion of the autocatalytic NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> anion from the
  surface and hence focus the etching on the initial sites of attack. This
  ability to achieve &#8220;focussed etching&#8221; enables acidic silicon
  etching to be used to texture silicon surfaces. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>There are
three main regions of etching that can be identified on these iso-etch curves.
In region 1 depicted in Figure 3, the concentration of HF exceeds that of the
HNO</span><sub><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>3</span></sub><span
style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'> and the etching become limited by the
rate at which the surface can be oxidised by the HNO</span><sub><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>3</span></sub><span
style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'> and so the etch rate depends largely
on the HNO</span><sub><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>3</span></sub><span
style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'> concentration. In this region,
although the reflectivity of an etched silicon surface can be quite low (e.g.,
less than 20%), the surface can be very porous with multi-crystalline grain
boundaries etched very deeply, and cells fabricated from these wafers typically
have lower open-circuit voltages. In region 2, the HNO</span><sub><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>3</span></sub><span
style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'> concentration is much larger than the
HF concentration and the etching rate becomes limited by the rate at which the
HF can diffuse to the silicon surface to solubilise the oxidised silicon. In
this region, the etching rate depends primarily on the HF concentration.
Silicon surfaces etched in this region typically can become electro-polished if
the HNO</span><sub><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>3</span></sub><span
style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>:HF wt% ratio is greater than 7. This
results in surfaces which are quite reflective with minimum reflectance values
typically greater than 28%. In the third region, the concentrations of HF and
HNO</span><sub><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>3</span></sub><span
style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'> are approximately the same and the
etching rate depends mainly on the diluent (i.e., water) concentration. Most
industrial acidic texturing baths use a composition where the HNO</span><sub><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>3</span></sub><sub><span
style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'> </span></sub><span style='font-family:
"Arial","sans-serif"'>concentration is greater than the HF concentration but
the ratio of HNO</span><sub><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>3</span></sub><span
style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>:HF wt% is maintained between 2-6 to
ensure that electro-polishing does not occur. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Acetic acid
is often used as the diluent in acidic etching baths and consequently the term
&#8220;HNA&#8221; etching is used where the &#8220;H&#8221; refers to HF, the
&#8220;N&#8221; to HNO</span><sub><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Arial","sans-serif"'>3</span></sub><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>
and the &#8220;A&#8221; to acetic acid. In industrial acidic texturing water
typically replaces acetic acid due to its lesser cost. The use of acetic acid
can have some advantages. First, because it has a higher dielectric constant
than water it causes the HNO</span><sub><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>3</span></sub><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>
to dissociate less resulting in more effective generation of the oxidant, NO<sub>2</sub>.
Second, it helps the etching solution &#8220;wet&#8221; the hydrophobic silicon
surface because it is more polar than water. However these advantages do not
outweigh the additional expense involved in using acetic acid and the risk of
contaminating subsequent processing steps with organic residue.</span></p>

Acidic Texturing</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Acidic
texturing is typically performed in industry using an in-line machine where
wafers are conveyed through the etching solution between top and bottom rollers
so that both surfaces of the wafers are textured. The bath is usually
maintained at 6-10 degrees C to exploit the autocatalytic and exothermic
properties of silicon etching and enable focussed etching at the defect sites
which result from saw-damage. If the bath temperature is too high then the
etching rate will be too high and difficult to control. Also high temperatures
will increase the diffusion of reaction products from the reaction site
resulting in less focussed etching and higher reflectivity. The etching time is
maintained very short in order to increase throughput. Preferably it is
maintained between 1-3 mins depending on the equipment supplier and the baths
can be up to 6 m in length. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Bath length
and liquid first fill volume is dependent on the machine&#8217;s designed
capacity. In order to keep the acid bath uniform and for safety reasons, the
machine is designed to be very shallow. A large recirculation tank is located
underneath the processing bath and in this tank the acidic solution is chilled and
maintained at the required process temperature. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Industrial
acidic texturing solutions can vary in composition. However, a commonly-used
&#8220;recipe&#8221; adopted in industry is the &#8220;UKN&#8221; recipe
because it was developed at the University of Constance (Konstanz). With this
recipe typically the HF and HNO</span><sub><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>3</span></sub><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>
concentrations are maintained at 10-25 and 40-50 vol%, respectively, and the
diluent is water. This means the composition is slightly on the
electro-polishing side. It typically results in minimum reflectance values of
24-25% when implemented correctly. Manufacturers of acidic texturing equipment
typically specify a bath make-up recipe and then dosing instructions which
maintain the HF and HNO</span><sub><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
"Arial","sans-serif"'>3</span></sub><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>
concentrations at the ideal levels. The dosing levels depend on how the HF and
HNO</span><sub><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>3</span></sub><sub><span
style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'> </span></sub><span style='font-family:
"Arial","sans-serif"'>are consumed by the etching reaction. Intermediates of
the etching process (e.g., nitrogen oxides) can be lost as volatile gases which
are removed by exhaust system. Equipment providers typically specify the
exhaust conditions to be used because the feeding of the bath will depend on
gas formation and potential loss of oxidant via the exhaust. Some HF can also
be lost in the exhaust of these baths and so correct exhaust ducting is very
important.</span></p>

needs to be accounted for in the bath dosing procedure. However, even with
routine dosing/bleeding of the bath to control the levels of HF, HNO</span><sub><span

million processed wafers are common practice, although the actual lifetime
depends very much on the cleanliness of the incoming wafers. Foreign elements,
which do not dissolve in the bath, can be carried in by the wafers and can
accumulate in the bottom of the bath. Periodically baths must be emptied and
cleaned, and the etching solution appropriately treated and disposed. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Most
manufacturers suggest that the optimum etch loss is 4-5 um per side. Acidic
texturing performance is often controlled by monitoring the etch loss and
altering the speed at which the wafers are transported through the bath to ensure
the ideal etch loss. Performance control can also be achieved using
reflectivity measurements and bath chemical analysis.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>When using
the &#8220;UKN&#8221; recipe, the final textured surface comprises multiple
concave etched regions which are in the order of 5-10 um in length. From the
scanning electron microscope images shown below in Figure 5, at lower
resolution these concavities appear like &#8220;worms&#8221;. If the wafers
surfaces are over-etched then the concavities increase in size and the surface
become more reflective.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>The
&#8220;as-cut&#8221; surface of wafers is typically very rough as shown in
Figure 6a. If the surface is insufficiently etched, then a crack-dominated
texture results (see Figure 6b). Although the average reflectance of this
texture is typically lower than 24% enabling a higher short circuit current to
be recorded in final devices, significant surface damage is still present and
this results in lower open circuit voltages. If surfaces are etched well beyond
the damaged layer the wafer surface becomes &#8220;bubble-like&#8221; as shown
in Figure 6d and typically has a much higher reflectance.</span></p>
