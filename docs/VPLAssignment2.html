<p style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Assignment 
  2 familiarises the user with the texturing process in manufacturing silicon 
  solar cells. Texturing is designed to decrease the amount of light reflected 
  from the solar cell's surface by producing pyramids that cause incident light 
  to be multiply reflected before having a chance to escape.  Pyramid formation 
  is most effective with a particular crystal orientation for the silicon known 
  as (100) orientation.  It is therefore far less effective with <span class=SpellE>multicrystalline</span> 
  silicon wafers than single crystal wafers. The temperature, sodium hydroxide 
  concentration, propanol concentration, exhaust flow rate and the time in the 
  chemical bath are the processing parameters that may be specified by the user. 
  The assignment batch again contains 10 wafers. All other processing parameters 
  for all other processes throughout the production line must again remain fixed 
  at the default values and therefore cannot be varied for this assignment.</font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Your overall 
  aim is to achieve the highest performance cells but while simultaneously achieving 
  good yields.  There are <b>help files</b> that can be accessed to help you understand 
  and learn about the significance of the texturing parameters and their optimisation.  
  There are also various tests you can perform on finished and partially finished 
  cells to help monitor <span class=GramE>performance</span> during processing. 
  You may process multiple &#147;Assignment batches&#147;, in order to achieve the best 
  possible results.  You will submit the results from one batch to satisfy task 
  A and may submit the results from separate batches to satisfy the requirements 
  of Tasks B &amp; C.   Often in manufacturing, we find that the batch that produces 
  the highest efficiency cell (as required for task A, does not necessarily produce 
  the highest average cell efficiency for the whole batch (as required for task 
  B).  Each task is worth one third of the marks, with the efficiencies achieved 
  and pyramid coverage area directly determining the marks awarded:</font></p>
