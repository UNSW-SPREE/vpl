  <i>Figure:  Equipment for making spectral response measurements with the light 
  source in the top left corner, the box of filters in the middle that only transmits 
  a narrow band of wavelengths at a time, optical fibre cables that transmit the 
  monochromatic light to the cell, and the test equipment for measuring the cell’s 
  resulting current.</i></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Spectral response tests involve  the 
  measurement of the current generated by a solar cell as a function of the wavelength 
  of incoming light.  Typical test equipment is shown and described above.  At 
  each wavelength, the percentage of incoming photons that successfully generate 
  electron-hole pairs that contribute to the cell&#146;s short circuit current are 
  determined and defined as the quantum efficiency (QE).  The internal QE ignores 
  the effect of any reflected light while the external QE is reduced in accordance 
  with the % of reflected light that is subtracted from the IQE value at each 
  wavelength.</font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Silicon 
  cells do not respond equally to all wavelengths of light. Short wavelengths 
  of light (ultraviolet) are absorbed extremely close to the top surface making 
  the surface recombination velocity, emitter doping and junction depth of major 
  importance.  At the other extreme, light with wavelengths &gt; 1 micron are 
  quite weakly absorbed in silicon since the photon energy is quite close to that 
  of the bandgap in silicon.  Such photons therefore tend to be absorbed uniformly 
  throughout the material, with approximately half of them therefore generated 
  towards the rear of the cell making the rear surface recombination velocity 
  and bulk minority carrier diffusion lengths of greatest importance.  The very 
  best cells have IQE values close to 100% for virtually all wavelengths in the 
  range 0.35 microns to 1.1 microns.  In comparison, screen-printed cells tend 
  to have deep and heavily diffused emitters with poor surface passivation that 
  give low QE values for short wavelengths of light.  CZ and multicrystalline 
  silicon wafers also have low carrier lifetimes that tend to give poor response 
  to longer wavelengths of light.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All silicon cells have QE values 
  close to zero for wavelengths &gt; 1.1 microns.  This results from the fact 
  that silicon is transparent to such wavelengths since the photons do not have 
  sufficient energy to create electron-hole pairs (i.e. break covalent bonds).  
  Below is an example of IQE and EQE curves for a silicon solar cell.</font></p>
