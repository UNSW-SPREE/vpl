<p align="justify" style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Virtually 
  all manufactured crystalline silicon solar cells use p-type substrates, therefore 
  necessitating the formation of an n-type emitter to create the p-n junction 
  for collecting the charge generated by the photons of light.  Virtually all 
  n-type layers are produced via a phosphorus diffusion at high temperature.  
  These diffusions essentially have two steps to the process, the first involving 
  the deposition of a phosphorus containing film or dielectric onto the surface 
  of the wafer, and the second involving a high temperature treatment that allows 
  the phosphorus from this layer to diffuse into the surface of the p-type wafer.</font></p>

        <td><p style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One 
          approach to depositing the phosphorus containing layer is to use a spin-on diffusion 
          source that contains phosphorus.&nbsp; These diffusion sources are available in silicon 
          dioxide based liquids or polymer based liquids but in general achieve similar 
          results provided similar levels of purity and provided both are appropriately 
          dried before being raised to high temperatures in the range of 900-1000<span>&deg;</span>C.&nbsp; 
          These sources are applied by spin-coaters with the liquid source being applied 
          to the centre of the wafer prior to the wafer being spun at a speed and for 
          a duration determined by the parameters set for the spin coater.&nbsp; These are 
          similar to the systems used in the microelectronics industry for applying photoresist 
          to wafers prior to mask aligning.</font></p></td>

  </table>
</div>
<p align="justify" style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The faster the spin speed, the thinner the 
  layer produced.  Too fast an acceleration, however, can lead to the liquid being 
  prematurely thrown off the wafer before having a chance to properly coat the 
  entire surface, particularly when it is textured.  This is a wasteful process 
  with often more material being spun off the wafer than remains coating the surface.  
  </font></p>
<p align="justify" style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These 
  diffusion sources can also be obtained with different concentrations of phosphorus 
  that therefore achieve different dopant profiles.  The highest concentration 
  sources act like infinite sources of phosphorus that ensure the phosphorus concentration 
  at the surface of the wafer is always determined by the solid solubility of 
  the phosphorus in the silicon at the particular diffusion temperature used.  
  For diluted or more lightly doped sources, the rate of phosphorus diffusing 
  into the surface of the silicon becomes limited by the availability of the phosphorus 
  in the deposited layer, therefore restricting the phosphorus concentration at 
  the surface of the wafer to below the solid solubility for the phosphorus in 
  the silicon.  Thickness of the deposited layer can also become of significance 
  for the more lightly doped sources as it is possible to fully deplete the very 
  thin layers.  </font></p>
<p align="justify" style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The drying 
  process is fairly straight forward for these diffusion sources, although it 
  is essential that they be properly dried before passing into the high temperature 
  furnace zones.  Layers not properly dried will tend to crack and lose their 
  intimate contact with the surface of the silicon wafer, at least in some regions 
  where the spin-on source is thickest and therefore least well dried.  It then 
  becomes near impossible to diffuse phosphorus effectively into these regions 
  of the silicon.  Many spin-on sources will actually take on a &#147;whitish&#147; appearance 
  when this occurs with a particular problem being the bases of pyramids where 
  the layers tend to be thickest. </font></p>

        design that uses the infrared lamps for the belt furnace to be located only 
        beneath the belt rather than both above and beneath the belt as is the case 
        of many furnace designs.&nbsp; Alternatively, the power to the lamps needs to be 
        limited to prevent the highest light intensities being produced as the lamps 
        cycle between high and low power under the control of the 3-term electronic 
        furnace temperature controller.&nbsp; Most of these furnaces have a drying zone typically

          a fine mist of phosphoric acid in a chamber through which the silicon wafers 
          pass on a belt.&nbsp; The mist settles or condenses on the exposed silicon surface 
          prior to passing into the drying zone for the belt furnace.&nbsp; The 
          diffusion source in this case is significantly cheaper than the polymer or silicon 
          dioxide based spin-on sources, but with the disadvantage that its application 
          is more critical and challenging to get right.&nbsp; The condensing phosphoric acid 
          forms small droplets on the silicon surface due to surface tension.&nbsp; These droplets 
          need to be the right size and the right density to enable effective diffusion 
          to follow.&nbsp; Droplets too large have similar problems drying to the case of spin-on 
          layers that are too thick, while droplets that are too small or a droplet density

<p align="justify" style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Other effects such as the cleanliness of the diffusion source 
  and furnace, the presence of contaminants on the wafer surface following preceding 
  cleaning steps or even stressing of the silicon wafer during the thermal treatments 
  can all potentially lead to a reduction in the minority carrier lifetimes.  
  In general, the higher temperatures that a wafer is exposed to, the greater 
  the potential for damage to the minority carrier lifetimes through contamination 
  or generation of defects.  On the other hand, phosphorus gettering properties 
  are well known although perhaps not well understood.  Gettering refers to the 
  <span
class=SpellE>immobilising</span> or deactivation of contaminants or defects that 
  would otherwise act as recombination sites.  Heavy phosphorus diffusions are 
  therefore usually accompanied by some improvement in the minority carrier lifetimes, 
  particularly for multicrystalline silicon wafers where enhanced diffusion down 
  grain boundaries appears to significantly reduce the recombination in these 
  regions.  At least some of these benefits result from the formation of the deep 
  lying junctions that transform the grain boundary regions from being minority 
  carrier sinks into minority carrier collecting regions.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The quality 
  of the emitter diffusion can also be affected by other key processing parameters 
  which include the drying time and temperature for the deposited phosphorus film, 
  the peak temperatures seen by the wafers during the diffusion process and of 
  course the time the wafer is exposed to such temperatures.  Rates of heating 
  and cooling the wafers and corresponding thermal gradients across the wafer 
  surfaces are also sometimes thought to be of importance in trying to minimize 
  the stresses and hence dislocation generation taking place in the wafers.  Considerable 
  investigative work aimed at evaluating this, however, has indicated that for 
  screen printed devices with open circuit voltages in the vicinity of 600 mV, 
  such stressing is not significant and in fact may actually help to assist gettering 
  processes when dealing with multicrystalline silicon wafers.  The remainder 
  of this section will focus primarily on the impact that the emitter diffusion 
  will have on the electrical properties of the solar cell, particularly with 
  regard to the impact on the fill factor, short circuit current and the open 
  circuit voltage of the device.  </font></p>
<p align="justify" style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The emitter 
  diffusion can have a significant impact on the device fill factor primarily 
  through variations in the corresponding series resistance of the device.  Generated 
  electrons collected by the junction must travel laterally in the diffused n-type 
  emitter as majority carriers until the metal contact is reached.  These electrons 
  therefore sustain resistive losses, the magnitude of which are determined by 
  the lateral conductivity of the emitter (sheet resistivity), the distance that 
  the electrons have to travel to reach the metal, and the number of electrons 
  (the magnitude of the current) flowing.  Another way in which the emitter diffusion 
  can affect the series resistance of the device is via its impact on the ability 
  of the front metal contact to form an <span class=SpellE>ohmic</span> contact 
  to the n-type silicon.  Screen printed (and other) metal contacts in general 
  require very heavy doping to avoid the formation of <span
class=SpellE>Schottky</span> barriers and other unwanted resistive effects.  The 
  depth of the junction can also be quite important as the metal must always be 
  sintered at high temperatures to ensure good contact is made both from a mechanical 
  and electrical perspective.  If the junction is not sufficiently deep, the metal 
  can approach or even reach the junction with corresponding deleterious effects 
  on the series resistance and potentially even the junction recombination that 
  will cause the ideality factor (n) to rise, therefore further reducing the fill 
  factor.  These effects will be discussed in more detail in conjunction with 
  the metal contact formation processes.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The impact 
  of the emitter diffusion on current is quite important.  Sunlight comprises 
  a large number of photons of different energy levels determined by the wavelength 
  of the light.  High energy photons (short wavelength light at the blue end of 
  the spectrum) will be absorbed within the silicon material very rapidly and 
  in close proximity to the light receiving surface.  Longer wavelengths of light 
  (e.g., red light) will penetrate further into the silicon, typically several 
  microns, which in general will take most of these photons beyond the junction 
  location.  Infrared light (wavelengths corresponding to photon energy levels 
  approaching the bandgap energy for silicon of 1.12 <span class=SpellE>eV</span>) 
  will tend to penetrate hundreds of microns into the substrate with significant 
  amounts actually reaching the rear surface of the device.  Virtually all of 
  the photons of light that are absorbed within the silicon generate electron 
  hole pairs that can potentially contribute to the short circuit current of the 
  solar cell.  A key parameter is the minority carrier lifetime of the charge 
  generated through this process, as this will determine whether the charge can 
  survive long enough to be able to diffuse to the junction to be collected and 
  therefore contribute to the device short circuit current.  </font></p>
<p align="justify" style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When considering 
  the impact of the emitter diffusion, we therefore need only consider the wavelengths 
  of light that will have significant amounts absorbed within the emitter.  In 
  particular, the shortest wavelengths of light (ultraviolet light and blue light) 
  will be absorbed (and therefore generate electron-hole pairs) in very close 
  proximity to the wafer surface.  Unfortunately, most of this charge is often 
  unable to be collected by the junction because either the emitter is diffused 
  too heavily which drastically reduces the minority carrier lifetimes or else 
  the junction is too deep so that the generated charge (in this case the holes) 
  is unable to diffuse as a minority carrier to the junction.  Charge that does 
  not have a sufficiently long minority carrier lifetime will simply recombine 
  in the silicon, giving up the energy that was absorbed from the light, in the 
  form of heat.  A compromise results because the emitter needs to be reasonably 
  heavily doped with phosphorus to ensure adequate lateral conductivity to keep 
  the resistive losses at respectable values.  In general, once the sheet resistivity 
  of a device falls below 100 ohms/square, there are inevitably regions at the 
  surface of the device that are &#147;dead&#147; from the perspective that significant 
  amounts of the charge generated in such regions cannot be collected by the junction.  
  For screen printed solar cells, the sheet <span
class=SpellE>resistivities</span> are normally well below this value, typically 
  in the range of 40-50 ohms/square.  At these values, a significant dead layer 
  exists at the surface that not only prevents the collection of charge generated 
  by the ultraviolet light, but even leads to significant losses from the charge 
  generated by the highest intensity wavelengths of light in the solar spectrum, 
  namely the green light.  This light will be absorbed mostly within the first 
  1-2 microns of the silicon, with typically 10% of this being absorbed within 
  the dead regions near the surface where the collection of the charge is poor.  
  </font></p>
<p align="justify" style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <span class=SpellE>nett</span> 
  result is that the heavy phosphorus diffusions needed for screen printed solar 
  cells cause a dead layer at the surface that leads to poor response to the short 
  wavelengths of light (blue light).  Even at the peak of the solar spectrum, 
  there is typically a 10% loss in the amount of charge collected and able to 
  contribute to the device current (green light).  The longer wavelengths of light 
  in the infrared region are relatively unaffected by the emitter profile and 
  sheet resistivity.  Most of this light is absorbed within the bulk of the device, 
  with the corresponding collection probability for the generated charge being 
  determined more by the minority carrier lifetimes for the wafer material and 
  also the rear surface conditions.  </font></p>
<p align="justify" style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is 
  important to note that even if the sheet resistivity of the emitter was raised 
  to above 100 ohms/square to minimize recombination within the emitter, it is 
  still necessary to passivate the surface.  Otherwise the surface will still 
  effectively create a dead layer as it provides large numbers of recombination 
  sites for the charge generated in close proximity.  Where the surface quality 
  is poor with a large density of recombination sites, we call this a high surface 
  recombination velocity.  Most screen printed solar cells have a high surface 
  recombination velocity.  This in itself however does not harm the performance 
  as the charge generated near the surface would not have been able to be collected 
  by the junction in any case due to the heavy emitter doping.  For high efficiency 
  devices it is therefore necessary to not only have a lightly diffused emitter 
  (with sheet resistivity above 100 ohms/square) but also a well passivated surface 
  (which we call a low surface recombination velocity).  </font></p>
<p align="justify" style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The open 
  circuit voltage of the device is also related to the recombination throughout 
  the device.  This is because the open circuit voltage corresponds to the terminal 
  voltage across the device when the total photogenerated current exactly equals 
  the total recombination current (i.e. total generation equals total recombination).  
  Reducing the recombination in the device will allow a higher terminal voltage 
  to be therefore achieved when satisfying the condition of total generation equaling 
  total recombination.  This recombination current is directly related to the 
  dark saturation current of the device which is in turn dependent upon various 
  factors such as the doping concentrations in the emitter and base, the corresponding 
  minority carrier lifetimes in the emitter and base, and also the surface recombination 
  velocities.  It should be noted that the surface recombination velocities only 
  have an effect if the charge recombining at the location could have otherwise 
  been collected by the junction.  In the same way that light generated charge 
  in dead regions of the device cannot contribute to the short circuit current, 
  neither do these regions contribute to the recombination current under open 
  circuit voltage conditions.  Consequently, these inactive regions of the device 
  also do not contribute to the dark saturation current.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The relevance 
  of this to screen printed solar cells is the fact that with a heavy phosphorus 
  diffusion, the very heavily diffused dead regions near the surface do not actually 
  hurt the voltages of the cell because they are inactive.  Similarly, high recombination 
  velocity light receiving surfaces do not hurt the screen printed solar cell 
  voltages for the same reason, because this region of the device is effectively 
  dead due to its isolation from the active parts of the device by the heavy phosphorus 
  diffusion.  In general, screen printed solar cells will instead have their voltages 
  limited more by the quality of the substrate or the rear surface recombination 
  velocity which is also often very high leading to large amounts of recombination. </font></p>
