<p style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Assignment 
  8 familiarises the user with the formation of an anti-reflection (AR) coating 
  in the manufacturing of silicon solar cells. AR coatings are designed to decrease 
  the amount of light reflected from the solar cell's surface by causing destructive 
  interference for the light that would otherwise be reflected from the silicon 
  surface.  The use of such coatings can have a major impact on cells that are 
  not textured such as those made from multicrystalline silicon.  In these cases, 
  AR coatings are essential.  Providing the deposition temperature is within an 
  appropriate range, the gas flow for the deposition chamber and the furnace belt 
  speed are the main two processing parameters that may be specified by the user 
  that will impact the thickness of the AR coating. </font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another 
  important benefit of the AR coating is that it can be used to restrict the distance 
  the silver paste penetrates into the silicon.  This can be of benefit because 
  the phosphorus concentration within the silicon is normally higher towards the 
  surface of the silicon therefore facilitating lower contact resistance through 
  restricting the penetration depth of the metal.  This also facilitates the use 
  of shallower diffused junctions which may have benefits in reducing the surface 
  dead layer.  The thickness of the AR coating needs to be optimised for reducing 
  surface reflection although independently of this, varying the deposition temperature 
  will vary the hardness of the layer which in turn can be used to affect how 
  easily the metal penetrates through and therefore how far it penetrates into 
  the silicon.  There are tests that enable you to measure the surface reflection 
  and hence determine the effectiveness of the AR coating at reducing reflection.  
  However, the measurement of the Jsc is probably the most useful indicator since 
  this is directly proportional to the amount of light entering the cell.</font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The assignment 
  batch again contains 10 wafers. All other processing parameters for all other 
  processes throughout the production line must again remain fixed at the default 
  values and therefore cannot be varied for this assignment.  Your overall aim 
  is to achieve the highest performance cells but while simultaneously achieving 
  good yields.  There are <b>help files</b> that can be accessed to help you understand 
  and learn about the significance of the AR coating and its deposition parameters  
  and their optimisation.  There are also various tests you can perform on finished 
  and partially finished cells to help monitor the effectiveness of the processing. 
  You may process multiple “Assignment batches”, in order to achieve the best 
  possible results.  You will submit the results from one batch to satisfy task 
  A and may submit the results from a separate batch <span class=GramE>to</span> 
  satisfy the requirements of Task B.   Often in manufacturing, we find that the 
  batch that produces the highest efficiency cell (as required for task A, does 
  not necessarily produce the highest average cell efficiency for the whole batch 
  (as required for task B).  Each task is worth equal marks, with the efficiencies 
  achieved directly determining the marks awarded:</font></p>

<p style='
'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>1.</span> Why does the optimisation 
  of the AR coating deposition conditions to produce the highest single screen-printed 
  cell efficiency lead to poor yields?</font></p>
<p style='

  coating help both the series resistance and also perhaps the cell short wavelength 
  response?</font></p>
<p style='
'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. Will the silver screen-printing 
  and firing processing parameters have to be reoptimised each time AR coating 
  deposition conditions are changed?</font></p>

  be reoptimised each time the diffusion conditions are changed?</font></p>

  uniformity in the AR coating thickness across the wafer?</font></p>
<p style='
