      the texturing solution without requiring the intermediate rinse in wafer.&nbsp; The 
      only challenges with the latter approach result from the need to have the texturing

2 – Saw Damage Removal Etch</span></b></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
  amount of silicon removed in the saw damage removal etch depends heavily on 
  the solution temperature and the time for etching, but only weakly on the actual 
  concentration of the sodium hydroxide provided the concentration is maintained 
  above 20% W/V.  The usual sodium hydroxide concentration is 30% W/V which simply 
  means that there are 300 grams of sodium hydroxide in each litre of solution.  
  Another factor that affects the etching rate is the accumulation of sodium silicate.  
  As the sodium silicate concentration increases, the viscosity of the etching 
  solution also increases, therefore decreasing the rate at which the hydrogen 
  gas is able to evolve from the surface.  This in turn reduces the etching rate 
  at the surface as the sodium hydroxide&#146;s effectiveness at reacting with the 
  silicon surface is reduced.  Eventually, the sodium silicate accumulation will 
  be so great that the viscosity will reach a sufficiently high level that the 
  evolving hydrogen trapped on the wafer surface will cause the cassette of silicon 
  wafers to float, making the etching unreliable and less effective.  </font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Without 
  the presence of a reasonable accumulation of sodium silicate in the etching 
  solution, the sodium hydroxide etch produces a highly polished surface to the 
  silicon.  Some manufacturers deliberately choose to retain high levels of sodium 
  silicate in this etching solution to retard the etching rate to about 1 micron 
  per minute while simultaneously avoiding the formation of the highly polished 
  surface.  In this latter regime, the silicon surface takes on a much rougher 
  appearance, looking more like the surface seen on cauliflower.  Some manufacturers 
  believe that this type of surface is superior for nucleating pyramid growth 
  during the subsequent texturing process.</font></p>

    <td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Excessive 
  etching in the sodium hydroxide will lead to wafers becoming thinner than desirable.&nbsp; 
  This is not only wasteful in terms of consumption of silicon and chemicals, 
  but also leads to wafers with reduced strength that can adversely affect the 
  number of breakages that occur during etching and subsequent processing.&nbsp; Increased 
  losses during manufacturing such as through breakages are referred to as &#147;yield&#147; 
  losses.&nbsp; Yield losses do not necessarily correlate with reduced performance 
  solar cells but do impact the overall cost of solar cells produced.&nbsp; </font></td>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At 
  the other extreme, insufficient etching to remove saw damage can often lead 
  to <span class=GramE>a degradation</span> in the minority carrier lifetimes 
  of the wafers during subsequent high temperature processing.  This can result 
  from the propagation of the damage into the bulk of the crystalline silicon 
  material or even the adverse affects of incompletely removed contaminants from 
  the damaged regions penetrating into the crystalline silicon.  </font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
  are several cautions to heed with regard to the saw damage removal etch.  </font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1.   Sodium silicate 
  is a very good thermal insulator therefore causing long periods of time delay  
  if for any reason the bath temperature needs to be reduced.  It is even feasible 
  for the heat given off during the etching process to exceed the rate at which 
  heat is dissipated from the top surface of the etching solution and the walls 
  of the etching bath.  In this situation, the bath temperature steadily increases 
  during the etching process even with zero electrical power applied to the heating 
  elements.  This can inadvertently lead to significantly increased etching rates 
  which can further exacerbate the problem with excessive bath heating.  In this 
  situation, some of the sodium silicate needs to be removed although manufacturers 
  in general will only replace half of this etching bath at a time so as to retain 
  adequate levels of sodium silicate to produce the preferred surface finish.  
  </font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2.   Once the sodium 
  silicate concentration exceeds a certain level, the solution needs to be kept 
  at temperatures above room temperature to prevent solidification.  The change 
  of density upon solidification can damage the etching tanks or baths although 
  in general the solidification process can be reversed.</font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3.   Some manufacturers 
  mistakenly believe that it is not possible to re-melt the solidified solution 
  described above without destroying the heating elements.  This is the result 
  of the fact that the sodium silicate melts too slowly and transfers heat too 
  poorly to allow the energy being dissipated within the heating element to be 
  transferred at a reasonable rate to the solidified material.  Without careful 
  constraints to limit the electrical power delivered to the heating element, 
  the inevitable result is that the heating element is destroyed by the excessively 
  high temperatures.  Careful controls need to be implemented to drastically limit 
  the amount of electrical energy delivered to the heating elements to prevent 
  this problem and to allow the sodium silicon to gradually melt over a period 
  of 1-2 days.  </font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4.   When initially 
  establishing an etching solution of 30% W/V sodium hydroxide, it is important 
  to realize that concentrated sodium hydroxide is significantly <span class=GramE>more 
  dense</span> than water.  Consequently, if highly concentrated liquid sodium 
  hydroxide is added to water, the tendency will be for the concentrated solution 
  to sink directly to the bottom of the tank and not intermix with the water.  
  This is the principle upon which solar ponds operate, with the resulting concentration 
  gradient producing a corresponding density gradient.  When heat is then dissipated 
  in the densest region of the etching solution, the density gradient suppresses 
  convention preventing the heating of the upper layers of the solution.  Temperature 
  differences as high as 30 degrees have been measured between lower regions and 
  upper regions of solutions, with corresponding very poor consequences for the 
  etching process, particularly with regard to uniformity across the wafer surface.  
  Whenever making new solutions, thorough stirring is essential to ensure a uniform 
  mixture.  </font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5.   At the completion 
  of etching, wafers need to be transferred relatively quickly to either a rinsing 
  bath of water or else directly into the texturing solution as shown below.  
  If this transfer does not take place within about 15 seconds, the sodium silicate 
  will solidify on the surface with corresponding adverse effects for subsequent 
  texturing and even high temperature processes if the sodium silicate is not 
  removed in a hydrofluoric acid solution.  </font></p>
