  The choice of these parameters impacts the ease with which the aluminium paste can be forced through the screen.&nbsp; To mask the areas of the stainless

  application of multiple layers of emulsion.&nbsp; This emulsion thickness will also 
  impact the resulting thickness in the layer of aluminium deposited onto the wafer surface.&nbsp; Other factors 
  affecting the thickness of the deposited aluminium layer include the pressure of the squeegee as it passes across the screen surface, 
  the speed at which the squeegee travels and also the paste viscosity.</font></p></td>

    <td><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
  further decision when designing the screen relates to the type of pattern to 
  be utilised.&nbsp; Some manufacturers choose to form a 
  grid pattern on the rear of the wafer as shown.&nbsp; This is done usually to reduce 
  material costs, although on occasions, grid patterns are used to allow bifacial 
  operation whereby light is able to penetrate into the silicon wafer via the 
  rear surface.&nbsp; </font></p></td>

    <td><span style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When the metal used is aluminium, the 
  use of a grid pattern instead of a solid pattern for the rear metal is usually 
  accompanied by some loss in performance.&nbsp; The magnitude of this loss depends 
  on several factors including the thickness of the wafer, the wafer resistivity, 
  the firing conditions for the aluminium paste, the 
  amount of phosphorus that penetrates into the rear surface during the phosphorus 
  emitter formation, etc.&nbsp; Most wafers have a lightly phosphorus diffused layer 
  of silicon forming across the rear of the wafer, which is then destroyed during 
  the firing of the aluminium paste.&nbsp; The aluminium paste easily penetrates to a greater depth than the phosphorus although when 
  a grid pattern is used, the rear junction is only destroyed in the regions where 
  the aluminium paste is deposited.&nbsp; Therefore, although 
  the grid pattern allows good ohmic contact to be formed 
  to the p-type substrate of the wafer, it leaves the surface as a whole with 
  an extremely high surface recombination velocity due to the regions where the 
  rear junction is not destroyed but rather periodically shunted.&nbsp; </font></span></td>

  a grid pattern is being used on the rear of the wafer, the screen design is 
  particularly important.&nbsp; If the stainless steel strands are too large in diameter 
  relative to the density of the mesh, the holes become too small to force adequate 
  quantities of paste through the screen onto the wafer surface.&nbsp; At the other 
  extreme, however, if the strand diameter is too small, the pressure applied 
  by the squeegee too easily damages the screens.&nbsp; In this regime, the squeegees 
  stretch the stainless steel mesh beyond its elastic limit leading to a very 
  poor lifetime for the screen.&nbsp;</font></p></td>

      There is therefore an ideal mesh strand diameter 
  that has adequate strength for long life expectancy for the screens while being 
  small enough in diameter so that the gaps between the strands are at least as 
  large as the strand diameters.&nbsp; It is of course possible to use a larger strand 
  diameter and a corresponding lower mesh density to still achieve gaps between 
  the strands that are at least as large as the strand diameters.&nbsp; However, lower 
  mesh densities necessitate wider minimum resolutions in the lines that can be 
  printed using the screen printing process.&nbsp; This is because it is in general 
  unreliable to print metal lines that are much narrower than twice the spacing 
  between the metal strands of the mesh.&nbsp; The meshes are usually also mounted 
  at 45&deg; to the squeegee direction to minimize the chance of fine 
  breaks in the printed lines which are higher in probability when the strands 
  run directly across the line being printed.&nbsp; </font></span></td>

      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
  emulsion thickness is also of particular importance when a grid pattern is being 
  used.&nbsp; The emulsion thickness does not need to be very great on the upper surface, 
  although on the lower surface it is important that it be as thick as the layer 
  of paste needing to be printed.&nbsp; The emulsion on the underneath side prevents 
  the squeegee from pushing the stainless steel mesh closer than a certain distance 
  to the silicon surface.&nbsp; Ideally, aluminium paste 
  thicknesses of at least 20 microns are desired, therefore necessitating an emulsion 
  thickness of the underneath side of the stainless steel mesh of similar dimensions.&nbsp; 
  If this emulsion thickness is too great, it then becomes quite difficult to 
  force the paste through the screen to reach the wafer surface unless either 
  a very low paste viscosity is used or else extremely high squeegee pressure.&nbsp; 
  None of these extremes are desirable.</font></td>

      The 
  squeegee pressure needs to be adequate to force the desired amount of paste 
  through the screen.&nbsp; Additional pressure beyond this simply causes wear and 
  tear to the screens and the squeegee surface.&nbsp; With regard to the squeegee speed, 
  slow speeds reduce the throughput of the system, while too high a speed again 
  prevents the squeegee from adequately forcing the paste through the stainless 
  steel mesh.&nbsp; Often, the higher the squeegee speed, the higher the squeegee pressure 
  needed to force a certain amount of paste through the mesh.&nbsp; </font></span></td>

      With 
  regard to paste viscosity, solvents are available and often need to be added 
  as the solvents in the paste evaporate reasonably quickly following the paste&#146;s 
  application onto the top surface of the screen.&nbsp; Paste that has been sitting 
  on the screen surface for some time may need to be removed and re-mixed with 
  additional thinners.&nbsp; Again, if the viscosity is too great, it becomes difficult 
  to force adequate quantities of paste through the stainless steel mesh without 
  excess squeegee pressure.&nbsp; At the other extreme, if the viscosity of the paste 
  is too low, then printing a grid pattern will be followed by a smearing of the 
  grid lines as the paste is not viscous enough to retain its profile (cross sectional 
  shape) as originally determined by the screen printing process.&nbsp; In addition, 
  there will be a tendency for the paste to form a mess on the screen as it flows 
  uncontrollably.&nbsp; The other disadvantage of low viscosity is that the layer of 
  paste becomes more difficult to dry and there is also additional loss in thickness 
  during firing due to the higher percentage of solvent and correspondingly lower 
  percentage of aluminium in the paste.&nbsp; More shrinkage correspondingly results 
  in an analogous fashion to concrete that is made too runny.&nbsp; </font></p></td>

      If 
  a solid pattern is selected for the rear metal contact, the design of the screen 
  is not so critical although it is still necessary to force adequate volumes 
  of paste through the stainless steel mesh.&nbsp; Considerably more paste is obviously 
  required for this type of pattern relative to a grid pattern.&nbsp; Of particular 
  importance with this type of screen design is the pressure used for the squeegee.&nbsp; 
  Excess pressure will prevent layers of aluminium paste with a thickness in the vicinity of 20 microns

      This is because the emulsion is only able to keep the stainless 
  steel mesh separated from the silicon surface near the edges of the wafer with 
  a higher than desirable squeegee pressure therefore able to force the stainless 
  steel mesh significantly closer to the silicon surface in the central regions, 
  therefore causing thinner layers to be produced.&nbsp; At the other extreme, insufficient

      Following 
  printing, the wafers need to be transferred to the metal belt of the infrared-firing 
  furnace.&nbsp; A conveyor belt is normally used for this purpose with care having 
  to be taken to ensure no aluminium paste gets onto 
  either this conveyor belt or the metal belt for the firing furnace.&nbsp; This is 
  particularly critical since the wafers are face down when travelling on these belts, and any residual aluminium on these belts will be transferred onto the front surfaces of subsequent wafers 
  and then driven through the front junction of the solar cell during the firing 
  of the rear metal contact.&nbsp;</font></p></td>
