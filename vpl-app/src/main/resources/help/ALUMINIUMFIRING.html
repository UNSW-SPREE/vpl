      It 
  is important to properly dry the aluminium paste prior to the wafers reaching 
  the high temperature firing zone.&nbsp; Any solvents or thinners remaining when the 
  high temperature zone is reached will lead to their explosive evolution from 
  within the paste with the resulting tendency being to form a damaged and much 
  thicker than desirable oxide layer with a greater degree of ferocity.&nbsp; On 
  the other hand, a certain thickness of rear aluminium oxide layer is required 
  to keep the molten aluminium and molten aluminium/silicon regions in place.&nbsp; 
  For this purpose, oxygen is required in the ambient.&nbsp; Inadequate oxidation of 
  the aluminium surface can lead to pimples forming on the rear where the molten 
  aluminium and silicon material penetrates through the aluminium oxide layer.&nbsp; 
  Such pimples on the rear are quite destructive and will often lead to wafers 
  breaking during subsequent processing, particularly when the wafers are placed 
  on a wafer hold-down such as the base plate for the silver screen printer.</font></p></td>

      In 
  terms of achieving the best electrical properties for the aluminium back surface

  solubilities and therefore higher doping concentrations for the aluminium within 
  the silicon.&nbsp; The trade-off, however, is <span class=GramE>that higher temperatures</span> will lead to increased consumption of the aluminium as more of it is consumed

      In general, therefore, higher temperatures need to 
  be accompanied by higher belt speeds so as to quickly ramp the wafers up to 
  the desired temperature and then subsequently rapidly cool the wafers down to 
  minimise the depth of the alloying process.&nbsp; For 
  this reason, temperatures are rarely taken much above 900<sup>o</sup>C as the 
  required thicknesses for the aluminium paste become too great to be economically 
  viable and too thick to reliably print through the screen-printing process.&nbsp; 
  Even with temperatures in the mid-800&#146;s range, the aluminium paste thickness 
  still, in general, needs to be at least 20 microns thick to facilitate retention 
  of aluminium at the rear for contacting purposes.&nbsp;</font></p></td>

      Many manufacturers will choose 
  to screen print narrow strips of silver onto the rear specifically for contacting 
  purposes (as shown)<b>.</b>&nbsp; These contain small quantities of aluminium 
  so as they can be printed into gaps in the pattern for the screen printed aluminium 
  and still make good ohmic contact to the p-type silicon substrate.&nbsp; Several 
  percent of aluminium can be tolerated within the silver paste without damaging 
  its solderability and this is sufficient to facilitate good ohmic contact formation

      There 
  is also evidence that the fast ramp up rate and fast cool down rate for the 
  aluminium alloying process is beneficial for improving the back surface field, 
  independently of the other benefits associated with reducing the consumption 
  of aluminium.&nbsp; The reasons for the improved electrical properties for the fast 
  ramp rates are not well understood although one theory is that it enhances gettering 
  processes through the increased stress that results on the wafers (gettering 
  refers to the immobilising or extraction of contaminants or defects from within 
  the silicon that would otherwise contribute to recombination processes).&nbsp; </font></p></td>

        Another 
        possible explanation for the improved back surface field performance is that 
        the faster cooling rate helps quickly freeze the molten aluminium/silicon region 
        without allowing time for the redistribution of the dopants (aluminium).&nbsp; The 
        molten alloyed region containing silicon and aluminium forms initially at the 
        interface between the silicon and the aluminium once the temperature exceeds 
        577<sup>o</sup>C.&nbsp; As the temperature continues to rise, more silicon is consumed 
        into the molten region while on the other side of the melt, all the aluminium 
        becomes molten.&nbsp; While at high temperature, the silicon continues to be dissolved 
        by the molten region with a resultant concentration gradient for the aluminium 
        ranging from almost zero at one edge of the molten region ranging up to 100% 
        at the other edge.&nbsp; Rapid cooling and hence rapid freezing of this molten region 
        apparently helps retain the described concentration gradient in the aluminium, 
        which appears to be beneficial for the back surface field performance.&nbsp; Slow 
        cooling inevitably leads to more mixing between the aluminium and silicon and 
        a less optimal concentration gradient for the aluminium within the silicon.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The described cooling process is often aided by a relatively high belt speed, 
        (compared to other infrared belt furnace processes), and the inclusion of several 
        cooling fans mounted at the tail end of the furnace to blow cool air onto the 
        wafers as soon as they depart from the hot zone.</font></p>
