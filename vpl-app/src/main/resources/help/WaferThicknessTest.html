<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Incoming wafer thicknesses are specified 
  by the cell manufacturer with a certain allowable tolerance, both in absolute 
  thickness and allowable non-uniformity across the wafer surface.  Wafer producers 
  sort their wafers prior to delivery to the cell manufacturer using an automated 
  system similar to that shown below.  The accuracy of such measurements is usually 
  quite good.  However, a cell manufacturer should nevertheless do periodic checks 
  as part of their quality control procedures and will typically use a micrometer 
  or a more sophisticated piece of equipment such as that shown above with a digital 
  readout of the thickness in millimeters.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thickness measurements are also important 
  following chemical etching to ascertain whether the right amount of silicon 
  has been removed so as get rid of all the saw damage on the surface resulting 
  from the wafering process.  Excess silicon removal will lead to wafers being 
  thinner than desirable while insufficient silicon removal will lead to residual 
  saw damage of the surface and likely subsequent deterioration in the minority 
  carrier lifetimes.</font></p>
