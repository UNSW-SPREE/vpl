  5 (Aluminium Screen-printing and Firing)</span></b></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Assignment 
  5 focuses on the formation of the rear metal contact using screen-printed aluminium 
  paste followed by high temperature firing to alloy the Al to the Si.  The process 
  can be split into two, a printing step followed by the drying and firing process 
  in the furnace.  For the printing process, the user controllable parameters 
  include the strand diameter of the mesh for the screen, the number of strands/cm 
  for the screen mesh, the emulsion thicknesses for the top and bottom surfaces 
  of the screen that define the pattern,  the paste viscosity and the squeegee 
  pressure and speed.  The alloying process is carried out in a belt furnace, 
  with the first section of the furnace being the drying zone to ensure the paste 
  is dry.  The processing variables to be user specified for the alloying process 
  <span
class=GramE>are :</span> belt speed (which affects both the drying and the metal 
  firing times); drying temperature; Zone 1, Zone 2 and Zone 3 temperatures; nitrogen 
  gas flow;  and the percentage of oxygen mixed with the nitrogen. Zone 1 and 
  Zone 3 temperatures should again be selected to be approximately 200 degrees 
  below the Zone 2 temperature so as to help maintain a uniform temperature profile 
  across the Zone 2.  All other processing parameters for all other processes 
  throughout the production line remain fixed at the default values and therefore 
  cannot be varied for this assignment.</font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The assignment 
  batch contains 10 wafers. You may process as many batches as you like while 
  trying to optimise the processing parameters of the &#147;aluminium screening and 
  firing&#147;.  Your overall aim is to achieve the highest performance cells but while 
  simultaneously achieving good yields.  There are <b>help <span class=GramE>files</span></b> 
  that can be accessed to help you understand and learn about the significance 
  of these aluminium screen-printing and firing parameters and their optimisation.  
  There are also various tests you can perform on finished and partially finished 
  cells to help monitor performance during processing. You may process multiple 
  &#147;Assignment batches&#147;, in order to achieve the best possible results.  You will 
  submit the results from one batch to satisfy Task A and may submit the results 
  from separate batches to satisfy the requirements of the other Tasks.   Often 
  in manufacturing, we find that the batch that produces the highest efficiency 
  cell (as required for task B), does not necessarily produce the highest average 
  cell efficiency for the whole batch (as required for task C).  Each task is 
  worth 20% of the marks, with the efficiencies/lifetimes achieved directly determining 
  the marks awarded:</font></p>
<h1><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Assessable Tasks (all tasks are

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;'>Task 
  A:</span></b><span>    </span>To produce the cell with the highest pseudo efficiency

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;'>Task

  The higher the efficiency the higher the mark)</font></p>

  is 0).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;'>Study Questions</span></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. For the cell with the highest 
  pseudo efficiency, why is its real cell efficiency so much lower?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. What yield problems can occur 
  through this process and what are the causes?</font></p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. Higher minority carrier lifetimes 
will in general improve the cell performance.  Why does this not always seem to 
happen with the aluminium firing?</font>
