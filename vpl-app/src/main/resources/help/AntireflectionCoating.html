      The 
  figure to the right shows a schematic of a silicon surface coated with a dielectric 
  layer of thickness T.&nbsp; The mechanism by which the dielectric layer (Antireflection 
  coating) is able to reduce the surface reflection of silicon is by light reflecting 
  from the silicon/dielectric surface being as close as possible to180 degrees 
  out of phase with the light being reflected from the air/dielectric interface, 
  with the two reflected components therefore acting to cancel each other out.&nbsp;</font></p></td>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  The 180 degree phase shift is achieved for a given wavelength <span style='font-family:Symbol'>l</span> 
  by making the thickness of the dielectric layer T = <span style='font-family:Symbol'>l</span> 
  /4 (where <span style='font-family:Symbol'>l</span> is the wavelength the light 
  has within the dielectric layer).  The reflected light will therefore have a 
  phase shift of half a wavelength (2T) and therefore destructively interfere 
  with the light component reflected from the dielectric/air interface to reduce 
  the total reflection.  The other important factor is that the amplitude of these 
  two reflected components that are 180 degrees out of phase with each other also 
  <span class=GramE>need</span> to be of similar magnitude to give lowest reflection.  
  The magnitude of each of these components is determined by the refractive indices 
  of the two materials at each respective interface. The refractive index of the 
  dielectric layer is therefore chosen relative to that of the silicon material 
  and air so as to minimise reflection.  This necessitates the dielectric layer 
  having a refractive index preferably within the range of 1.9-2.1.  </font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
  should be noted that the right thickness and refractive index for the dielectric 
  layer can in fact lead to zero reflection for a given wavelength of light.  
  Unfortunately, sunlight comprises a wide range of wavelengths of light.  The 
  effectiveness of the antireflection coating becomes progressively less effective 
  the more the wavelength departs from its designed value.  Antireflection coatings 
  are therefore designed to give the best overall performance for the solar spectrum 
  which means designing it to be most effective for green light.  For this reason, 
  cells will often look blue, simply because the resulting reflection is somewhat 
  higher for the shorter wavelengths of the visible spectrum than the longer wavelengths.  
  In comparison, many laboratory cells will use multiple layer antireflection 
  coatings so as to be able to reduce the reflection to zero for multiple different 
  wavelengths of light from within the solar spectrum.  This gives a black/dark-green 
  appearance.  In general, the economics do not favour this approach with commercial 
  cells, with single layer antireflection coatings being used on almost all commercially 
  manufactured solar cells.</font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
  principle, the antireflection coating can be applied at just about any point 
  in the processing sequence.  Many years ago, it was considered preferable to 
  apply the antireflection coating at the end of processing so as to avoid contamination 
  of the silicon wafer by the antireflection coating during high temperature processing 
  and to avoid the necessity for the antireflection coating to withstand the various 
  processing conditions.  The problem however with this approach is that the metal 
  is then coated by the antireflection coating, unless some form of masking is 
  used during the antireflection coating deposition. Coated metal necessitates 
  subsequent removal of the AR coating from the metal to facilitate contacting/soldering.

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Just as importantly, new screen printing 
  paste formulations shown to the right have been developed to enable the screen-printed

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Perhaps 
  the most important development in screen printed solar cell technology in the 
  last 20 years has been the formulation of new metal pastes and processing conditions 
  that facilitate the deposition of the antireflection coating prior to screen 
  printing while still facilitating subsequent metal contact formation.  The critical 
  issue in achieving this compatibility has been the necessity to fire the screen 
  printed metal paste through the antireflection coating so as to provide good 
  ohmic contact to the underlying diffused n-type layer of silicon without damaging 
  the nearby junction.  The obvious immediate benefit is that such an approach 
  will allow all the benefits of reduced surface reflection offered by the antireflection 
  coating but without the problems associated with the deposition of the AR coating 
  onto the metal surface.  There are, however, significant other benefits. </font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When 
  screen printed solar cell technology was first developed approximately 30 years 
  ago, it was necessary for the diffused n-type silicon to be both heavily doped 
  to facilitate good ohmic contact to the metal and also reasonably thick so as 
  to prevent the metal from penetrating to the junction region during its subsequent 
  firing.&nbsp; For decades, screen printed solar cells therefore had deep junctions 
  with heavily phosphorus diffused emitters, primarily for compatibility with 
  screen printed metal pastes that inevitably penetrate a certain distance into 
  the silicon when fired at elevated temperatures to achieve the required metallic 
  properties.&nbsp;</font></p>

  shown to the right) prior to metal paste deposition makes it possible to minimise 
  the penetration distance of the metal paste into the diffused emitter.</span>&nbsp; 
  This is beneficial for two reasons, firstly, to facilitate the use of shallower 
  junctions and secondly to enable the silicon/metal interface to reside closer 
  to the silicon surface following firing at elevated temperature.&nbsp;</font></p></td>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The latter 
  is important as the phosphorus concentration is higher near the surface and 
  therefore able to produce lower contact resistance.  The importance of reducing 
  the depth of the junction relates to the fact that electron hole pairs generated 
  right at the surface of the silicon have further to travel to the junction to 
  be collected if the junction is deeper.  This is a problem for many screen printed 
  solar cells for a couple of reasons.  Firstly, the diffusion lengths in the 
  emitter are very short because of the damage and the effects of the heavy phosphorus 
  doping.  Secondly, the distance for the holes to travel to the junction is further, 
  therefore allowing more to recombined before being collected.  Thirdly, because 
  the surface <span class=SpellE>passivation</span> for screen printed solar cells 
  is generally poor, it becomes energetically favourable for many of the generated 
  carriers (holes) to go to the surface to recombine rather than travelling to 
  the junction to be collected.</font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
  use of screen printed metal contacts fired through an antireflection coating 
  not only requires the right chemical formulation for the metal paste (to facilitate 
  its penetration through the dielectric layer), but also the right properties 
  for the antireflection coating layer.  For the latter, the deposition conditions 
  will have significant impact on the hardness of the layer and also its thickness, 
  both of which will have significant impact on the ability of the metal to penetrate 
  through the antireflection coating and into the silicon surface.  If, for instance 
  the antireflection coating is too thick or too hard, the metal will not penetrate 
  far enough through the AR coating to make contact with the silicon.  If on the 
  other hand the AR coating is too thin or too soft, the metal will then penetrate 
  too far into the silicon and therefore damage the junction and hence the solar 
  cell performance.  The deposition conditions for the AR coating are therefore 
  of significant importance, particularly if a shallow emitter is being used.  
  These AR coating deposition conditions need to be optimised in conjunction with 
  the firing conditions for the screen printed silver metal contact since clearly 
  both sets of conditions in combination determine the penetration depth of the 
  metal into the silicon relative to the junction location.</font></p>

  easily and cheaply applied by spraying, will normally be deposited by atmospheric 
  pressure chemical vapour deposition (APCVD) for fire-through contacts so as 
  to give the required reproducibility and spatially uniform properties.&nbsp; This 
  is normally done using a belt furnace for high throughput as shown above.&nbsp; When 
  the belt carries the wafers into the chemical reaction chamber which is normally 
  heated to a temperature in the vicinity of 150-200 degrees C, the gases containing 
  the titanium are fed into the chamber, react/decompose and facilitate the formation 
  of the titanium dioxide layer on the wafer surface.&nbsp;</font></p></td>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> If the deposition temperature 
  is too high, the resulting layer is harder/tougher than desirable for facilitating 
  the formation of the metal fire-through contacts.  If the temperature is too 
  low, the right chemical formulation for producing the titanium dioxide is not 
  achieved and the resulting layer is not only too soft, but lacks the required 
  optical and electrical properties for subsequent processing and solar cell operation.</font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
  other type of commonly used antireflection coating for fire-through contacts 
  is silicon nitride.  This can be deposited by either low pressure CVD (LPCVD) 
  or plasma enhanced CVD (PECVD).  The advantage of the latter is that atomic 
  hydrogen is generated in the reaction chamber and therefore incorporated into 
  the deposited silicon nitride layer.  This can be particularly beneficial with 
  <span class=SpellE>multicrystalline</span> cells as the hydrogen is able to 
  penetrate the grain boundaries during any subsequent high temperature processing.  
  This atomic hydrogen is very reactive and able to tie up (passivate) dangling 
  bonds that inevitably exist at any interruptions/discontinuities in the crystalline 
  silicon lattice.  Passivating these dangling bonds essentially means they no 
  longer act as recombination sites, therefore improving the overall silicon wafer 
  quality, particularly in the grain boundary regions or where defects are present.</font></p>
