<h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pseudo Current-Voltage (IV) Measurements</font></h4>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">True 
  current-voltage measurements can only be made once both metal contacts have 
  been applied to the solar cell surfaces.  It is very useful, however, to be 
  able to measure the pseudo I-V curve prior to applying the metal contacts.  
  This test is quite similar in many ways to that used for determining the minority 
  carrier lifetimes for the material.</font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
  pseudo IV measurements rely on <span class=GramE>pulsing</span> the wafer with 
  a bright light and taking rapid measurements of the wafer&#146;s photoconductivity 
  as a function of the light intensity as the light pulse decays.  As explained 
  in the section relating to lifetime measurement tests, the photoconductance 
  measurement relates directly to the minority carrier concentrations in the wafer 
  at the particular light intensity.  This in turn can be equated to a voltage 
  that would be produced by that wafer at that carrier concentration.  It is therefore 
  possible to determine an implied voltage <span class=GramE>for each light intensity</span>, 
  with each light intensity in turn, being equivalent to a certain current flowing 
  through the device.  An implied I-V relationship can therefore be determined 
  which we describe as being a pseudo-I-V curve. </font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
  pseudo I-V curve differs from the real I-V curve that would be produced by an 
  equivalent device, as there are no resistive losses within the semiconductor 
  material or at the metal/silicon interfaces or within the metal itself.  It 
  therefore produces an IV curve that is the same shape that would be expected 
  from the finished device if the latter had its series resistance losses removed.  
  This test will therefore provide useful feedback on other loss mechanisms within 
  the device other than those related to series resistance losses.  These include 
  shunting effects or losses in fill-factor resulting from junction recombination 
  (observed through a high ideality factor).  The pseudo IV curve will also give 
  a good indication as to the likely open circuit for the completed device.  </font></p>
