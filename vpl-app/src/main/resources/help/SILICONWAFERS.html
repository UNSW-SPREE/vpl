      The <b>wafer thickness </b>can be easily measured as shown. It has an impact 
      on the strength of the wafer, the performance of the final solar cell, and the 
      cost of the wafer.&nbsp; In general, the economics favour thinner wafers although 
      once wafers are produced below 0.2 mm thick, the strength of the wafers declines 
      sufficiently that considerable care in wafer handling and production processes 
      are necessary to prevent significant numbers from breaking.&nbsp; With improved processing 
      techniques and automation, the industry trend is towards the use of thinner 
      wafers to take advantage of the reduced costs that accompany the utilisation 
      of less silicon per wafer.&nbsp; At present, commercial processes in general suffer 
      performance loss with reduced thickness due to the inability to absorb as much 
      of the sunlight and the relatively poor rear surface quality that leads to the 
      loss in current generation for light absorbed in close proximity.&nbsp; With this 
      type of cell structure, thinner wafers simply lead to more of the light being 
    absorbed in these regions close to the rear surface where the light is ineffective.<br>

      The <b>wafer resistivity</b> is directly related to the amount of boron incorporated 
      into the silicon wafer.&nbsp; The dark saturation current component generated within 
      the bulk of the wafer is inversely proportional to the boron doping concentration 
      assuming all else remains unchanged.&nbsp; The dark saturation current indirectly 
      determines the open circuit voltage of the solar cell, therefore in general 
      leading to manufacturers specifying wafer resistivities that correspond to higher 
      boron concentrations so as to produce solar cells with higher voltages.&nbsp; There 
      is a limit, however, above which solar cell performance degrades due to the 
      higher boron concentrations leading to reduced minority carrier lifetimes within 
      the bulk material of the silicon wafer.&nbsp; These lifetimes simply refer to the 
      typical length of time that charge survives when generated through the absorption 
      of appropriate photons of sunlight.&nbsp; Reduced minority carrier lifetimes will 
      therefore degrade the current generating capabilities of the solar cell and 
      can even cause solar cell voltages to fall despite the beneficial effect of 
      the increased boron doping.&nbsp; Typical wafer resistivities are in the range of 
      0.3-3 &#937;cm, with 1 &#937;cm being most common.&nbsp; The resistivity 
    can be measured by a 4-point probe tester as shown.</font><br>

      The <b>wafer size</b> or area is roughly proportional to the current generation 
      for the solar cell.&nbsp; Doubling the area will, in general, lead to double the 
      amount of light absorbed by the silicon and hence double the current.&nbsp; Manufacturers 
      in general like larger wafers as many of the processing costs are on a per unit 
      basis, independent of the wafer size.&nbsp; There are, however, disadvantages through 
      the use of larger wafers.&nbsp; These include increased resistive losses that result 
      from the increased challenge of extracting much larger currents from the larger 
      sized solar cells.&nbsp; These resistive losses are proportional to the square of 
      the current, and are exacerbated by the fact that larger sized solar cells also 
      necessitate most of the current having to travel longer distances to be extracted 
      from the solar cell.&nbsp; The nett result is that increased metal coverage is often 
      required leading to a higher percentage loss due to shading by the metal and 
      also increased costs for the metal per unit area of solar cell.&nbsp; The other disadvantage 
      of larger area solar cells is that the wafers in general need to be a little 
      thicker to give them adequate strength.&nbsp; This will of course have some negative 
      impact on the economics.&nbsp;</font></p>

  Various <b>wafer types</b> can be specified.  Multicrystalline wafers are in 
  general produced through casting processes which are lower in cost compared 
  to techniques such as Czochralski growth and float zoning which produce single 
  crystal silicon wafers.  In general, lower cost wafers will produce lower performance 
  solar cells with the overall trade-off very much dependent on the implementation 
  of the individual processes for solar cell fabrication in each production line.  
  For example, hydrogen passivation of grain boundaries can help reduce the negative 
  impact on solar cell performance but will add to the cost.  </font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
  little over half the wafers used in commercial cell production are multicrystalline 
  with most of the remainder being produced using the Czochralski growth technique.  
  Studies have indicated that float zoning (FZ) may have the potential to produce 
  wafers at similar costs to the Czochralski techniques. FZ however, has the significant 
  disadvantage at present that the silicon feedstock must be in a certain form. 
  This removes an important advantage of Czochralski and casting techniques which 
  are able to use off cuts and waste material left over from other processes such 
  as those involved in the integrated circuits industry.  At present, Czochralski 
  wafers produce higher performance solar cells than multicrystalline wafers but 
  significantly lower performance cells than float zone wafers.  The Czochralski 
  wafers are produced by melting the high purity silicon in a quartz crucible 
  and then gradually extracting a seed crystal from the melt over a period of 
  1-2 days during which time the molten silicon progressively crystallizes onto 
  the seed producing a cylinder.  A disadvantage is that oxygen is incorporated 
  into the molten silicon from the quartz crucible leading to relatively high 
  oxygen levels in the Czochralski wafers.  It has been shown that defects and 
  damage are caused when the oxygen and boron levels are above certain critical 
  levels, leading to minority carrier lifetimes that are degraded to well below 
  their float zone counterparts that are able to keep oxygen levels below the 
  critical value.</font></p>

  The <b>crystal orientation</b> only needs to be specified for single crystal 
  silicon wafers.  The preferred orientation for solar cell production is (100) 
  which makes it feasible to texture the wafer surface in low concentration anisotropic 
  etches such as sodium hydroxide to produce upright tetrahedral pyramids on the 
  surface that reduce surface reflection.  Such texturing processes are less effective 
  on multicrystalline wafers due to the random nature of the crystals within such 
  wafers.  Alternative texturing processes that achieve similar effects have been 
  developed for such wafers that do not depend on the crystallographic orientation.</font></p>
