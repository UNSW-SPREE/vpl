  7 (Silver Screen-printing and Firing)</span></b></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Assignment 
  7 focuses on the formation of the front metal grid using the screen-printing 
  of silver paste followed by high temperature firing to facilitate ohmic contact 
  between the ag and the Si.  The process can be split into two, a printing step 
  followed by the drying and firing process in the furnace.   For the printing 
  process, the user controllable parameters include the strand diameter of the 
  mesh for the screen, the number of strands/cm for the screen mesh, the emulsion 
  thicknesses for the top and bottom surfaces of the screen that define the pattern,  
  the finger spacing, the paste viscosity and the squeegee pressure and speed.  
  The drying/firing process is carried out in a belt furnace, with the first section 
  of the furnace being the drying zone to ensure the paste is dry.  The processing 
  variables to be user specified for the firing process are : belt speed (which 
  affects both the drying and the metal firing time); drying temperature; and 
  the Zone 1, Zone 2 and Zone 3 temperatures. Zone 1 and Zone 3 temperatures should 
  be selected to be approximately 150 degrees below the Zone 2 temperature so 
  as to help maintain a uniform temperature profile across the Zone 2. These two 
  zones should also be significantly shorter in length than the Zone 2.   All 
  other processing parameters for all other processes throughout the production 
  line remain fixed at the default values and therefore cannot be varied for this 
  assignment.</font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The assignment 
  batch contains 10 wafers. You may process as many batches as you like while 
  trying to optimise the processing parameters of the &#147;silver screen printing and 
  firing&#147;.  Your overall aim is to achieve the highest performance cells but while 
  simultaneously achieving good yields.  There are <b>help files</b> that can 
  be accessed to help you understand and learn about the significance of these 
  aluminium screen-printing and firing parameters and their optimisation.  There 
  are a large range of tests you can perform on the finished cells to help diagnose 
  any weaknesses. The primary aim in optimising the processing conditions is to 
  produce a final IV curve that as closely as possible approximates the pseudo 
  IV curve from prior to the silver contact application.  This involves minimising 
  the series resistive losses (Rs) associated with extracting the generated current 
  from the solar cell but while simultaneously trying to minimise shading losses. 
  The shading losses can be observed through the reflection test while insight 
  into the Rs losses can be gained through the IV curve, the pseudo IV curve, 
  the series resistance, the silver paste thickness (before and after firing) 
  and the silver resistance test. You may process multiple &#147;Assignment batches&#147;, 
  in order to achieve the best possible results.  You will submit the results 
  from one batch to satisfy Task A and may submit the results from separate batches 
  to satisfy the requirements of the other Tasks.   Each task is worth 25% of 
  the marks, with the efficiencies achieved directly determining the marks awarded:</font></p>

<p style='
'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>1. </span>Why is it a meaningless 
  task to try and optimise the pseudo efficiency through optimisation of the silver 
  screen-printing and firing processing parameters?</font></p>
<p style='
'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>2.&nbsp;</span>Will the silver 
  screen-printing and firing processing parameters have to be reoptimised each 
  time the phosphorus diffusion parameters are changed?</font></p>
<p style='
'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>3.&nbsp;</span>Why can the inclusion 
  of an AR coating help both the series resistance and also perhaps the cell short 
  wavelength response?</font></p>
<p style='
'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>4.&nbsp;</span>In what ways 
  would the cell design change if much narrower screen-printed lines could be 
  reliably produced?</font></p>
<p style='
'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span>5.&nbsp;</span>What factors, 
  when designing and using the screen, are responsible for restricting the Ag 
  paste thickness and why?</font></p>
