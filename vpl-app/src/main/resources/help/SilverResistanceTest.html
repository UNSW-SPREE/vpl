<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Following 
  the firing of the silver screen-printed contact, a simple test involving the 
  voltage drop along a silver metal finger can be performed to give a good indication 
  of the resistive losses within the silver metal contact.  The cell is placed 
  under the solar simulator as shown above and contacted by the test probes so 
  as to put the cell in short circuit conditions.  This causes the maximum photogenerated 
  current to flow within the silver metal lines, therefore maximising the resistive 
  losses as all the current generated around the edge of the cell has to travel 
  along the metal lines to reach the busbar.  A multimeter set on DC voltage can 
  then be used to measure the voltage difference between one of the busbars and 
  the metal line that runs along the edge of the cell in the direction parallel 
  to both the busbar and the cell edge.  For most commercial cells (that are typically 
  12.5cm X 12.5cm), the separation between these two measurement points is about 
  3cm.  In a good cell with low resistive losses, this voltage measurement may 
  be as low as below 20mV, while in a cell with poor conductivity in the metal, 
  this voltage drop may be as high as 100mV.  For the latter, if the cell would 
  normally be expected to have a maximum power point voltage (Vmp) of 500mV, such 
  a high resistive loss along the metal fingers could cause the Vmp to fall to 
  approximately 400-450mV, representing a fillfactor loss somewhere in the range 
  of 10-20%.</font></p>
