<h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Reflection Tests</font></h4>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One 
  of the most useful tests throughout the processing sequence for solar cells 
  is the measurement of the surface reflection for the partly processed wafer.  
  Reflection is a very important issue because silicon is naturally highly reflective 
  with typically 33% of incident light being reflected from a flat surface.  The 
  electric current generated by a solar cell is directly proportional to the amount 
  of light incident on the solar cell.  The loss of 33% of the light through reflection 
  will therefore decrease the current generated by 33% compared to what it would 
  have been without the reflection.</font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Reflection 
  tests are normally conducted as a function of wavelength and silicon will vary 
  somewhat in the magnitude of its reflection as the wavelength varies from roughly 
  0.3 micron wavelength light up to the other extreme of useful wavelengths which 
  is typically 1.1 microns.  </font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
  first useful <span class=GramE>point in the process for conducting a reflectance 
  test would be after the saw damage removal etch</span>.  At this stage, the 
  surface should be relatively flat and therefore provide the normal reflection 
  characteristics for crystalline silicon as shown in the figure below.  A reflection 
  test at this point could, however, give some insight into surface roughness 
  such as may occur if excessive saw damage remains or alternatively if a nicely 
  roughened surface has been prepared to assist in the pyramid nucleation in the 
  subsequent texturing step.  </font></p>

    <td><div align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Following 
      the texturing (see example to the right), there should be a drastic reduction 
      in the surface reflection.&nbsp; The quality of the texturing process can be quite 
      accurately gauged by conducting a surface reflection test at this point in the 
      process.&nbsp; Poorly formed pyramids or else gaps between pyramids will all tend 
      to reduce the opportunity for incoming light to receive double bounces before 
      being reflected.&nbsp; Such regions will therefore retain reflection magnitudes in 
      the vicinity of 33% rather than being reduced to the vicinity of 11% as normally 
      achieved through a well textured surface.&nbsp; The extent to which the overall reflection 
      exceeds 11% is probably a good indicator as to the area of the wafer surface 
      that has been poorly textured.&nbsp; Below is a typical reflection curve for a textured 
    surface.</font></div></td>

  <i>Figure: Reflection curve for a textured surface</i></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
  general, the texturing process does not introduce any wavelength dependent bias 
  into the reflected spectrum of light.  One factor, however, that can affect 
  this is if submicron pyramids are produced on the surface which therefore interfere 
  with the infra-red light that has wavelengths in the vicinity of the pyramid 
  dimensions.  Such small pyramids become incapable of achieving the normal double 
  bounce phenomenon due to these interference effects.  The nett result is therefore 
  often an increase in the amount of reflection at these longer wavelengths relative 
  to the rest of the spectrum and this increase should be able to be observed 
  in the reflection tests which give the surface reflection as a function of wavelength.</font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
  next useful point to conduct reflection tests is after the antireflection coating 
  deposition.  These AR coatings have a strong spectral bias as a function of 
  the thickness of the AR coating layer.  Identification of the wavelength at 
  which minimum reflection is achieved gives direct information regarding the 
  thickness of the AR coating layer.  An example is given in the figure below 
  in which the reflection for a flat silicon surface is given when coated with 
  a 70 nanometer thick antireflection coating that has a refractive index of 2.0.  
  Further information on this is given in the section on AR coating formation.  
  </font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
  other very useful time to conduct a reflection test is following the formation 
  of the front surface metal contact.  The metal tends to be highly reflective 
  such that the increase in the surface reflection following the formation of 
  the top metal contact gives direct feedback as to the percentage of the top 
  surface being covered and therefore shaded by the metal.  This shading percentage 
  is of course a direct loss as this percentage of light is unable to penetrate 
  into the silicon and therefore unable to generate electricity.  This component 
  of reflection will also have minimal spectral dependence and will therefore 
  simply increase the magnitude of reflection of each wavelength by a similar 
  absolute amount.</font></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
  use of reflection tests to help ascertain the quality of texturing is only useful 
  without the inclusion of an AR coating.  Even a badly textured surface will 
  typically have its surface reflection reduced to less than 1% following the 
  application of an optimal AR coating.  At such low values of reflection, variations 
  in quality of texturing are difficult to observe, <span class=GramE>which is 
  one of the reasons why some manufacturers choose to use an AR coating in their 
  process</span>.</font></p>
