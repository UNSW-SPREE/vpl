  Assessment<br>
  (Diffusion and Silver Screen-printing)</span></b></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This assessment 
  task is worth 10% of the marks in this course.  It focuses on optimising the 
  diffusion conditions in conjunction with the formation of the front metal grid 
  using the screen-printing of silver paste followed by high temperature firing 
  to facilitate ohmic contact between the Ag and the n-type Si.  These are probably 
  the most important two processes to optimise and the two with greatest interdependence.  
  </font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Experience 
  in optimising the diffusion conditions was gained during Assignment 4, although 
  reoptimisation will be necessary for this assessment task as the silver firing 
  conditions are altered. The silver screen-printing process can be split into 
  two, a printing step followed by the drying and firing process in the furnace.   
  For the printing process, the user controllable parameters include the strand 
  diameter of the mesh for the screen, the number of strands/cm for the screen 
  mesh, the emulsion thicknesses for the top and bottom surfaces of the screen 
  that define the pattern, the finger spacing, the paste viscosity and the squeegee 
  pressure and speed.  The drying/firing process is carried out in a belt furnace, 
  with the first section of the furnace being the drying zone to ensure the paste 
  is dry.  The processing variables to be user specified for the firing process 
  are : belt speed (which affects both the drying and the metal firing time); 
  drying temperature; and the Zone 1, Zone 2 and Zone 3 temperatures. Zone 1 and 
  Zone 3 temperatures should be selected to be approximately 150 degrees below 
  the Zone 2 temperature so as to help maintain a uniform temperature profile 
  across the Zone 2. These two zones should also be significantly shorter in length 
  than the Zone 2.   All other processing parameters for all processes other than 
  the diffusion step and the screen-printing/firing of the silver remain fixed 
  at the default values and therefore cannot be varied for this assignment.</font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This assessment 
  task will take a similar form to previous assignments except that you will also 
  be required to write a 2-page report that discusses the importance of the various 
  processing parameters and their interdependencies. The assignment batch will 
  again contain 10 wafers. You may process as many batches as you like while trying 
  to optimise the processing parameters of the “diffusion conditions” in conjunction 
  with the “silver screening and firing”.  Your overall aim is to achieve the 
  highest performance cells but while simultaneously achieving good yields.  There 
  are <b>help files</b> that can be accessed to help you understand and learn 
  more about the significance of the diffusion and silver screen-printing/firing 
  parameters and their optimisation.  There are a large range of tests you can 
  perform on partially processed and finished cells to help diagnose any weaknesses. 
  An important aim in optimising the processing conditions for the silver printing/firing 
  is to produce a final IV curve that as closely as possible approximates the 
  pseudo IV curve from prior to the silver contact application.  This involves 
  minimising the series resistive losses (Rs) associated with extracting the generated 
  current from the solar cell but while simultaneously trying to minimise shading 
  losses. The shading losses can be observed through the reflection test while 
  insight into the Rs losses can be gained through the IV curve, the pseudo IV 
  curve, the series resistance, the silver paste thickness (before and after firing) 
  and the silver resistance test. You may process multiple “Assignment batches”, 
  in order to achieve the best possible results.  You will submit the results 
  from one batch to satisfy Task (i) and may submit the results from a separate 
  batch to satisfy the requirements of Task (ii).   Each task is worth 25% of 
  the marks, with the efficiencies achieved directly determining the marks awarded.  
  The written report determines the other 50% of the marks.</font></p>
