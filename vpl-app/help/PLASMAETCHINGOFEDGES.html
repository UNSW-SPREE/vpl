<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most 
  of the phosphorus diffusion processes used commercially will lead to phosphorus 
  diffusing into all surfaces of the wafers including the rear surface and the 
  edges.  For good solar cell performance, it is necessary to prevent the photogenerated 
  electrons collected by the front junction from flowing down the phosphorus diffused 
  edges of the wafers to the rear surface where they are effectively lost. It 
  is equivalent to providing a conduction path down the edge of the wafers that 
  links the front and rear metal contacts which, are of opposite polarity.  The 
  amount of leakage current in this situation is therefore directly proportional 
  the terminal voltage of the solar cell.  When operating at the maximum power 
  point, this terminal voltage is likely to be in the vicinity of 500 mV.  Under 
  this bias, if more than a couple of percent of the current is being lost through 
  leakage down these edges, then the edge junction isolation must be improved 
  to reduce this conductivity.  </font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span
lang=EN-US>Edge leakage losses of this type are modelled in the solar cell equivalent 
  circuit through the placement of a resistor, known as the shunt resistance, 
  directly across the solar cell diode. Isolating these edge regions will therefore 
  increase the value of this shunt resistor.</span></font></p>

    <td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
  most commonly used approach for isolating or improving these edge regions is 
  to use <span class=GramE>a plasma</span> to etch away the unwanted phosphorus 
  diffused silicon in these regions.&nbsp; This is normally accomplished by first chemically 
  removing residual native or diffusion oxides and then&nbsp; &#147;coin stacking&#147; the wafers 
  as shown, in a similar fashion to the way coins are stacked in a pile.&nbsp; The 
  actual design of the plasma system and the chamber dimensions will determine 
  the size limits for such a stack of wafers.&nbsp; The wafers are then clamped together 
  as shown prior to placement in the vacuum chamber of the plasma system.&nbsp; </font></td>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">High 
  voltages, either AC or DC depending on the type of system, are applied to the 
  two electrodes within the vacuum chamber.  In the presence of appropriate gases, 
  electrical discharge results producing a purple glow in the round viewing window 
  as can be seen below.  This produces the required reactive ionic species as 
  the gas breaks down through the electrical discharge.  In a well designed plasma 
  system, the plasma (discharge) produced will be uniform spatially, although 
  this uniformity will also be somewhat dependent upon electrical power level, 
  gas flows, and the objects placed within the chamber for etching. </font></p>

  <tr>
    <td><span style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
  optimising this part of the process, the key processing parameters are the electrical 
  power delivered to the plasma and the duration for the plasma etching process.&nbsp; 
  If the power is too high, the ionic species produced in the plasma bombard the 
  wafer edges with sufficient energy to cause damage to the electrical properties 
  of the silicon wafers in the edge regions.&nbsp; It is therefore often preferable 
  to etch away the edge phosphorus diffused regions by using a somewhat lower 
  power level but longer duration.&nbsp; On the other hand, there is also a tendency 
  for the plasma to attack the front and rear surfaces of the wafers in the vicinity 
  of the edge by penetration along the cracks existing between adjacent wafers. 
  &nbsp;This damage will be enhanced for longer periods of etching, therefore leading 
  to a trade-off between the power levels and the duration of the etching process.&nbsp; 
  Damage to the edges caused by the high energy ionic species will lead to a small 
  loss in collection of carriers from the edge regions and therefore a slight 
  loss in short circuit current.&nbsp; The biggest effect, however, will normally be 
  to increase the device ideality factor &#147;n&#147;.&nbsp; This is because the removal of 
  the phosphorus diffused layer down the wafer edge exposes the front junction 
  and allows some damage to occur within the depletion region, thereby causing 
  an increase in the junction recombination.&nbsp; This manifests itself as an increase 
  in the device ideality factor.&nbsp; </font></span></td>

</table>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lower 
  powers, however, will lead to slower etch rates, therefore necessitating longer 
  etching periods.  If the process fails to remove all the phosphorus diffused 
  silicon, the device shunt resistance &#147;R<sub>sh</sub>&#147; falls.  If the shunt resistance 
  is observed to decrease unacceptably, then either the power level for the plasma 
  or the duration of the etching process must be increased.  If the duration of 
  the etching process is sufficiently long to allow damage to the front and rear 
  surfaces of the wafers, this will also manifest itself as an increased ideality 
  factor as the damage will inevitably penetrate to some regions of the front 
  junction.  If excessive, the latter may also cause a loss in open circuit voltage 
  and also short circuit current as the damaged regions act as highly efficient 
  recombination regions.  </font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An 
  additional constraint while optimising the power and duration for the plasma 
  etching process is the fact that the plasma itself may become unstable and non-uniform 
  if the electrical power level is too low.  Such unstable conditions will lead 
  to erratic results and potentially quite poor yields.  Depending on the design 
  of the plasma system, such spatial non-uniformity that accompanies unstable 
  plasmas may lead to some of the wafers being etched appropriately while others 
  receive either excessive or inadequate etching.  Alternatively, it may be possible 
  for some regions of all the wafer edges to be etched while other regions remain 
  unetched, therefore leading to all wafers having a poor shunt resistance.  Measurement 
  of the shunt resistance of solar cells is a very simple and easily performed 
  test and will quickly give insight into such problems.  </font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
  Voc contour test is another useful way to evaluate the effectiveness of the 
  edge junction isolation through the plasma etching.  With poor edge junction 
  isolation, the voltage measured falls significantly when approaching the edges, 
  indicating a poor shunt resister value in these regions.  The contours below 
  show an example, with the Voc falling to below 200mV near the edges.  If the 
  plasma etching is effective at removing this shunt, the voltages near the edges 
  in this test will only fall a relatively small amount.</font></p>
