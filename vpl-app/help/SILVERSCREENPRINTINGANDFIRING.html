      of metal needs to be kept to a minimum to prevent shading losses.&nbsp; Many of the 
      issues associated with the screen printing of silver paste are the same as for 
      screen-printing aluminium paste.&nbsp; The design of the screens, however, is more 
      critical as the width of the screen printed silver lines has an important impact 
      on the percentage of the cell front surface that is shaded by the metal.&nbsp; The 
      metal lines are normally called fingers which then carry the current from the 
      peripheral regions of the cell to the busbars that run perpendicularly to the 
      fingers and are of much greater width and often form the base onto which the 
      interconnect wires are soldered as shown to the left. In large-scale commercial 
      production, the minimum linewidth reliably achieved for the silver fingers is

      It is quite challenging to reliably and repeatedly 
      print screen-printed silver fingers with a width less than about four times 
      the strand diameter for the stainless steel mesh.&nbsp; This relationship simply 
      relates to the ability to force the paste through the stainless steel mesh and 
      the density of holes in a mesh necessary to ensure breaks do not occur in the 
      metal lines.&nbsp; These issues are the same as referred to in conjunction with the 
      screen-printing.&nbsp; The minimum linewidth for the metallization is therefore determined 
      by the strand diameter in the stainless steel mesh that needs to be used to 
      provide adequate strength for repeated use in screen printing in a production 
      environment.&nbsp; Narrower linewidths have been demonstrated either by using higher 
      density meshes with smaller strand diameter or else using standard stainless 
    steel meshes but with narrower openings in the emulsion.&nbsp;</font></div></td>

  problems through repeated use of the screens that deform as the stainless steel 
  mesh does not have the strength to withstand repeated use in production environment.&nbsp; 
  In the latter, the printing process tends to be unreliable due to minor breaks 
  that occur in the metal lines due to inadequate width in the metal lines.&nbsp;Any 
  tendency for holes to be blocked will automatically cause a break in the line 
  with no redundant holes available due to the narrowness of the emulsion opening.  
  Another alternative for finer lines is the use of a stainless steel sheet in 
  place of the mesh.  This sheet can have the screen-printing pattern etched into 
  it leaving narrow bridges in the etch lines for support.  <span

  screen-printing.&nbsp; This is because the metal lines need to be made as thick as 
  possible to minimize resistive losses.&nbsp; A certain cross-sectional area is needed 
  for the silver fingers to provide adequate conductivity, and since these lines 
  need to be kept as narrow as possible, this can only be achieved provided adequate 
  thickness in the vicinity of 20 microns can be achieved.&nbsp; It should be noted 
  that a 20-micron thick silver line will shrink to a little under half that height 
  when the paste is fired at high temperature.&nbsp; In addition, the resistivity of 
  screen-printed and fired silver is approximately a factor of three worse than 
  normal silver.&nbsp; For more information on the importance of the emulsion thickness

      Many manufacturers chemically clean the surface 
      of the silicon prior to applying the silver paste for the front metal contact.&nbsp; 
      This includes the removal of diffusion oxides and/or native oxides of the silicon 
      that form during previous high temperature processes.&nbsp; These are removed to 
      ensure good ohmic contact is achieved between the silver and the n-type silicon.&nbsp; The formation of the silver metal contact to 
      the phosphorus-diffused silicon is a critical step in the whole production process 
      and can have a major impact on the final device performance.&nbsp; Some manufacturers 
      therefore prefer to not have any variability in the surface conditions prior 
      to applying the silver paste.&nbsp; This is most easily achieved by using chemical 
      cleaning in hydrofluoric acid to remove oxide layers followed by rinsing, hydrochloric 
      immersion to remove metal contaminants, and a final rinse again in high purity 
    deionized water as shown above.&nbsp; </font></div></td>

  formation with this latter approach as any variability in the antireflection 
  coating thickness or material properties will directly impact the ability of 
  the silver to contact the underlying n-type silicon.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the highest 
  performance screen-printed cells will tend to use this approach but need to 
  have very careful in-line quality control to prevent problems with yields that 
  can occur if this particular part of the process cannot be formed repeatedly

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
  firing conditions are of considerable importance for the screen printed silver 
  metallization, potentially having a far greater impact on the device performance 
  than the firing conditions used for the rear aluminium metal contact.  The primary 
  performance parameter of the device affected by the firing conditions is the 
  series resistance and hence the fill factor for the device.  Variability in 
  the furnace temperature can lead to the fill factory varying anywhere from 25% 
  up to a maximum approaching 80%. </font></p>

  <tr>
    <td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To 
  understand the manner in which the firing of the screen-printed silver paste 
  can impact the series resistance of the device, it is important to recognize 
  the relative dimensions and thicknesses of the layers involved in forming the 
  ohmic contact.&nbsp; The phosphorus-diffused layer is typically less than a micron 
  in depth, while the finest screen-printed silver lines are normally at least 
  120 microns in width.&nbsp; During firing, the silver is driven into the phosphorus-diffused 
  silicon therefore acting to reduce the lateral conductivity of the phosphorus-diffused 
  silicon directly beneath the silver/silicon alloy region.&nbsp; If the silver is 
  driven too deep, very few of the electrons collected by the junction will be 
  able to flow into the n-type region directly below the silver metal due to the 
  excessively high sheet resistivity of the n-type layer in this region.&nbsp; This 
  forces most of the current collection by the metal contact to take place at 
  the very edges of each metal finger where the interface area with the phosphorus 
  diffused silicon is typically only about 1% of the total interface area between 
  the <span class=GramE>screen</span> printed silver and the silicon.&nbsp;</font></td>

</table>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This becomes 
  a severe problem as the silver has a relatively high work function, making it 
  difficult to achieve a good ohmic contact between silver and n-type silicon.  
  This is partially overcome by making the phosphorus doping of the silicon extremely 
  high, therefore preventing the formation of Schottky barriers between the silver 
  and the n-type silicon and enabling an ohmic contact to be formed.  Unfortunately, 
  however, the heaviest doped region of the phosphorus-diffused emitter is near 
  the surface.  Consequently, if the screen printed silver is driven too deeply 
  into the silicon, not only does it close off the phosphorus diffused silicon 
  channel beneath the silver as described above, but it also leads to the majority 
  of the interface between the silver and the n-type silicon being in regions 
  where the phosphorus doping is substantially lower and therefore vulnerable 
  to Schottky barriers and higher contact resistances per unit area.  </font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
  are therefore two effects that are able to significantly increase the effective 
  contact resistance for the screen-printed silver metallization.  One is a geometrical 
  effect that relates to the closing off of the phosphorus diffused emitter to 
  laterally flowing electrons that increases the contact resistance by forcing 
  most of the current collection to take place at the very edges of the metallization 
  with corresponding current crowding effects that contribute to the resistive 
  losses.  The second contribution is an electronic one where the actual contact 
  resistance per unit area increases with reduced phosphorus doping levels in 
  the silicon.  This electronic effect is contributed to by the high work function 
  of the silver that naturally tries to form Schottky barriers with n-type silicon.  
  These detrimental effects will also be enhanced by driving the silver paste 
  deeper into the emitter but also by the parameters and techniques chosen for 
  carrying out the phosphorus diffusion of the emitter which will in turn determine 
  the phosphorus doping profile and hence the phosphorus concentration in the 
  silicon at the interface point between the silver and the silicon.</font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
  above will suggest that it is preferable to have the silver penetrate as little 
  as possible into the phosphorus diffused silicon.  To an extent this is correct, 
  although adequate temperatures are necessary to convert the silver paste into 
  silver metal while simultaneously alloying it adequately with the phosphorus 
  diffused silicon to both provide mechanical robustness but also to help destroy 
  the Schottky barriers that will otherwise exist between the silver and phosphorus 
  diffused region.  </font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another 
  effect that production line operators should be aware of is that which relates 
  to the screen-printed silver metal being driven into the junction region and 
  beyond.  This phenomenon will be particularly important if the phosphorus diffusion 
  of the silicon during the emitter formation is not uniform such that the junction 
  depth varies spatially across the wafer.  Most silver pastes are protected from 
  shunting through to the p-type substrate by the high work function of the silver 
  that will tend to prevent it from forming an ohmic contact.  Shunting effects 
  are therefore rarely observed when the silver is driven through the front junction, 
  although contaminants such as aluminium are sometimes present in sufficient 
  quantities in faulty batches of silver paste to cause such shunting to occur.  
  However, even if shunting does not result when the silver penetrates through 
  the junction, the device ideality factor will rise significantly due to increased 
  junction recombination that results from the presence of metal ions or other 
  contaminants or defects within the critical regions of the depletion region 
  of the junction.</font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
  is important to recognize that whenever any change takes place with the way 
  the phosphorus diffused emitter is formed, the firing conditions for the silver 
  metallization should be re-optimized.  In general, however, the phosphorus concentration 
  needs to be in the vicinity of the solid solubility for phosphorus in silicon 
  in the region of the interface between the silver and the silicon to keep the 
  contact resistance at acceptable levels.  This unfortunately necessitates a 
  dead region near the surface of the solar cell since this level of doping near 
  the solid solubility needs to be maintained to a reasonable depth to coincide 
  with the depth that the silver needs to be driven to in the alloying process.

<table width="100%" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td><div align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
      superior approach implemented by some manufacturers is to use a dielectric layer 
      on the surface of the silicon to act as an extension to the silicon during the 
      process of firing the silver metallization.&nbsp; For example, if the silver alloying 
      needs to be driven to a depth of 0.2 microns to achieve adequate robustness 
      for the metal contact and adequate conductivity for the fired silver, then in 
      principle this depth can be reduced significantly if a dielectric layer such 
      as the antireflection coating can be deposited onto the silicon surface in a 
    manner by which it acts as an extension to the silicon.&nbsp; </font><span style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This approach has been 
  optimised in production and enables the silver/silicon interface to occur closer 
  to the silicon surface, therefore facilitating both shallower junctions and 
  also the location of the interface in the proximity of more highly doped silicon 
  that therefore aids ohmic contact formation.&nbsp; With this approach, sheet resistivities 
  for the emitter in the range of 50-70 ohms/square can potentially be used while 
  still facilitating adequately low contact resistances.&nbsp; This compares to the 
  more normal 40 ohms/square typically used with most screen-printed cells.&nbsp; The 
  higher sheet resistivity of 50-70 ohms/square makes it feasible to eliminate 
  most of the dead region at the surface with corresponding improved response 
  to short wavelengths of light.&nbsp; This improved response necessitates improved 
  surface passivation relative to conventional screen-printed solar cells. Otherwise 
  a similar poor response to short wavelength light will result as may also a 
  reduction in the open circuit voltage due to the increased contribution to the 
  dark saturation current resulting from the surface recombination.&nbsp; </font></span></div></td>
