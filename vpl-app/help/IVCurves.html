<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At 
  the completion of the manufacturing process, all solar cells are electrically 
  tested to determine their current-voltage relationship.  It is important that 
  all cells be graded and sorted so as to minimise subsequent mismatch between 
  cells when they are encapsulated into modules.  Electrical testing in general 
  involves measuring the current able to be generated by the solar cell for each 
  particular operating voltage across its terminals.  During this test, a large 
  number of data points are therefore generated which when put together form a 
  graph of current versus voltage which is known as the I-V characteristic curve.  
  At one extreme, the solar cell is short circuited with the corresponding current 
  generation known as the short circuit current.  At the other extreme where the 
  curve intersects with the voltage axis, zero current flows and hence the voltage 
  measured at this point is known as the open circuit voltage.  Of greater importance, 
  however, are the current and voltage at the maximum power point.  These are 
  the conditions under which the solar cell is operating at his highest possible 
  efficiency and therefore generating most output power.  This point occurs in 
  the vicinity of the knee in the curve and clearly, the squarer the curve, the 
  higher the output power.  For comparison purposes between devices, the relative 
  squareness of the curves is known as the fill factor which is defined as being 
  the maximum power point current (Imp) multiplied by the maximum power point 
  voltage (Vmp) divided by the product of the short circuit current and open circuit 
  voltage.  </font></p>

    <td><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
  the final electrical testing of each cell, the short circuit current, open circuit 
  voltage, Imp, Vmp and the fill factor are all determined.&nbsp; It is often also 
  important to know the parasitic resistance values with the total device series 
  resistance and the corresponding shunt resistance also determined through these 
  testing procedures.&nbsp;</font></p></td>

</table>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In general, the slope of the curve in the vicinity of the 
  short circuit conditions gives a direct indication of the shunt resistance value.  
  For example, in a good solar cell, the curve in this region is likely to be 
  very close to the horizontal indicating a very high shunt-resistor value.  A 
  good approximation of the shunt resistor value is <span style='font-family:Symbol'>d</span>V/<span style='font-family:
Symbol'>dI</span> in this region of the curve.  At the other extremity of the 
  curve near the open circuit conditions, the slope gives information regarding 
  the series resistance of the device.  The determined value, however, represents 
  the total series resistance of the device which includes the metal/silicon contact 
  resistance at both surfaces, the substrate resistance, the resistive losses 
  within both metal contacts and also the lateral resistance losses associated 
  with the lateral current flows in the emitter.  Separate tests can, however, 
  be applied to independently determine some of these components such as through 
  the &#147;silver metal resistance test&#147; or the &#147;substrate resistivity test&#147;.  
  </font></p>
<p ><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another parameter that can be determined 
  as part of the electrical testing is known as the ideality factor &#147;n&#147;.  In good 
  devices, this parameter is close to unity although with devices incurring damage 
  in the junction region, this ideality factor can increase and even approach 
  two in extreme cases.  The consequence of a high n-factor is that the fill factor 
  declines.  Junction recombination can result for various possible reasons such 
  as plasma-etched damage in the region of the edges, or metal being driven into 
  the junction region during contact formation.  </font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
  figure above shows a typical testing station in which the solar cells are measured 
  under the solar simulator and then sorted into one of typically 14 categories.  
  Within each category, cells are closely matched in their electrical parameters, 
  particularly from the perspective of their short circuit current.  The currents 
  of the cells need to be closely matched since, in general, manufacturers interconnect 
  cells in series to produce modules.  The solar simulator is calibrated to a 
  light intensity of 100 mW/cm2 and uses a precise spectrum equivalent to air 
  mass 1.5.  Reference cells that have been accurately calibrated are used to 
  set the light intensity and to carry out periodic checks to ensure the light 
  intensity has not drifted away from the specified intensity.  Standard test 
  conditions also involve holding the cell at 25<sup>o</sup>C, which is done via 
  a temperature-controlled block onto which the solar cell is placed for testing.  
  Below is a typical current-voltage characteristic curve for a screen-printed 
  solar cell.  </font></p>
