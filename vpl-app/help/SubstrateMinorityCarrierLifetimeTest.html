  Test</font>
</h5>
</span>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
  the context of this test &#147;lifetime&#147; refers to the minority carrier lifetimes 
  in the substrate of the wafer.  This refers to the average length of time that 
  an electron-hole pair will survive prior to recombining (or more precisely, 
  the time necessary for the generated minority carrier concentration to decay 
  to 1/e of its original value).  The value of this parameter is therefore affected 
  by all the recombination mechanisms within the active region of the wafer.  
  This of course includes the surfaces which can therefore make it difficult to 
  measure the lifetime of the minority carriers in the substrate material if in 
  fact the surface recombination velocity is high.  For this reason, lifetime 
  tests need to be conducted with wafers that have their surfaces well passivated.  
  For the purpose of the test, this is often achieved chemically using either 
  a special iodine based solution or else hydrofluouric (HF) acid to provide temporary 
  but effective surface passivation.  <span
class=GramE>For the latter, extreme caution needs to be exercised as HF is an 
  extremely dangerous acid and should never be used without thorough training 
  and permission from supervisors.</span>  </font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
  range of systems have been developed that facilitate the measurement of this 
  parameter.  Some involve <span
class=GramE>pulsing</span> the wafer with a bright sharp pulse of light and then 
  probing the wafer to observe its open circuit voltage decay.  The open circuit 
  voltage is a direct measure of the carrier concentration therefore facilitating 
  the use of the open circuit voltage decay as a measure of the carrier concentration 
  decay which, in turn, is a direct function of the carrier lifetimes.  This approach, 
  however, necessitates the existence of a junction and also probing of the wafer 
  surface.  </font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Probably 
  the preferred approach these days is based upon photoconductivity decay.  Another 
  measure of the carrier concentrations in the wafer is via its conductivity which 
  can be determined without contacting the wafer via an electric coil mounted 
  juxtaposed to the wafer.  The carriers can be excited by either a light source 
  or a laser and then the subsequent carrier concentration decay determined.  
  From this decay curve, the effective carrier lifetime can be determined.  An 
  example of such a curve is shown below.</font></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
  test can be useful for incoming wafers so as to ascertain their quality.  The 
  parameter will vary not only as a function of wafer quality but also as a function 
  of the doping concentration within the wafer.  For example, a more heavily doped 
  wafer will tend to have shorter minority carrier lifetimes simply because of 
  the higher concentration of majority carriers that are available for participation 
  in the recombination process.  Significant differences in minority carrier lifetime 
  are also anticipated with varying crystallographic quality such that multicrystalline 
  silicon wafers would, in general, be expected to have poorer lifetimes than 
  single crystal silicon wafers.  Furthermore, the multicrystalline wafers are 
  likely to have quite variable minority carrier lifetimes between crystals although 
  this particular test may not pick up this variation since it is normally performed 
  over a relatively large area of the wafer and therefore tends to provide a result 
  that represents the average over the illuminated area.  An example of a typical 
  system for making the lifetime measurements is shown below.</font></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lifetime 
  tests can be useful at any part of the process, particularly after high temperature 
  steps where there is opportunity for contamination to damage the wafer.  In 
  addition, some processes may even have the potential to increase the minority 
  carrier lifetime through gettering processes.  Probably the best example of 
  this is through the firing of the aluminium layer across the rear of the wafer.  
  </font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
  minority carrier lifetime will directly impact both the open circuit voltage 
  and the short circuit current of the solar cell.  For the former, the lifetime 
  directly impacts the calculation of the device dark saturation current, which 
  in turn, determines the open circuit voltage as described in the textbook.  
  The short circuit current is affected since the distance the minority carriers 
  are able to travel to be collected by the junction (the diffusion length) is 
  directly proportional to the carrier minority carrier lifetime.  For example, 
  a wafer with a minority carrier lifetime of 20 microseconds will typically have 
  a diffusion length a little over 200 microns.  As a rough guide, this indicates 
  that carriers generated more than 200 microns from the junction will have low 
  probability of contributing to the current generation of the device.  This means 
  that any device that has a thickness greater than the minority carrier diffusion 
  length will tend to have a poor response to longer wavelengths of light that 
  penetrate deeply within the silicon and generate carriers in the vicinity of 
  the rear surface.</font></p>
