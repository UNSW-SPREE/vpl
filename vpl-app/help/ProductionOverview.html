<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><span lang=EN-US>Production Overview</span></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Solar cells are devices that convert 
  sunlight directly into electricity.  The main component in a solar cell is a 
  silicon wafer, which is typically 15 cm x 15 cm in area.  Silicon is abundant, 
  low cost, environmentally friendly and easy to work with safely.  Silicon wafers, 
  however, represent the dominant cost in making solar cells, mainly because of 
  the high costs of purifying sand and then forming the silicon into a wafer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The highest quality silicon wafers 
  are made from a single crystal of silicon.  The single crystal growth process 
  is relatively lengthy and expensive.  Somewhat lower quality wafers can be produced 
  by casting techniques, where molten silicon is poured into a mould and allowed 
  to cool and solidify into a large multicrystalline ingot.  The ingot is sliced 
  into wafers like slicing a loaf of bread, using either the wire sawing technique 
  or an inner diameter diamond tipped saw.  These casting techniques are faster 
  and lower cost than single crystal growth methods, but the resulting multicrystalline 
  wafers are lower in quality and therefore produce lower performance solar cells.  
  Approximately half the solar cells made commercially use multicrystalline wafers 
  while most of the remainder use single crystal silicon wafers.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most solar cell manufacturers purchase 
  their silicon wafers from independent companies that specialise in their production.  
  Solar cell manufacturers usually specify the type of silicon wafer required, 
  its thickness, its area and its doping concentration.  Doping concentration 
  refers to the amount of an impurity, or dopant, added to the silicon during 
  the wafer manufacture to influence its conductivity and its effective polarity.  
  The most common dopant used is boron.  Boron is a valency 3 element, which means 
  that when included in crystalline silicon, it causes the material to act like 
  it is positive in polarity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The incoming wafers to the solar 
  cell manufacturer have damage at their surface from the sawing process.  Chemical 
  baths, usually containing sodium hydroxide, are often used to etch away some 
  of the surface silicon material, removing the damaged regions and any dirt and 
  contaminants.  The wafers are then rinsed in high purity water.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Texturing reduces reflection from 
  the wafer surface.  The wafers are placed in a lower concentration of sodium 
  hydroxide solution.  This solution, with the inclusion of propanol and various 
  other additives, becomes an anisotropic etch, which means that it etches some 
  planes of the silicon crystals more rapidly than others.  The slowest etching 
  planes, the &lt;111&gt; planes, are left exposed at the surface.  This can be 
  used to advantage in (100) orientation wafers where the exposed &lt;111&gt; 
  planes intersect to form pyramids on the surface of the wafer.  These pyramids 
  give incoming light to the solar cell multiple opportunities of penetrating 
  the silicon, because reflected light from one face of a pyramid will naturally 
  bounce across to the face of another pyramid.  This greatly reduces the effective 
  reflection from the front surface.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Following texturing, the wafers are 
  thoroughly rinsed in high purity water.  The wafers are then generally placed 
  into hydrofluoric acid, a particularly dangerous acid, which chemically removes 
  any sodium silicate left on the wafer surface after etching with sodium hydroxide.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The wafers are then rinsed again 
  and immersed in a final cleaning solution comprising dilute hydrochloric acid.  
  This acid is particularly effective at reacting with any metal atoms, which 
  if not removed can cause serious damage to the solar cell.  Metal atoms may 
  penetrate into the silicon material when the wafers are exposed to temperatures 
  approaching 1000<span>°</span>C.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Again, the wafers are thoroughly 
  rinsed in high purity water prior to being dried in a spin dryer in preparation 
  for high temperature processing.  Solar cell manufacturers need to produce their 
  own high purity water on site using elaborate filtration systems and deionizing 
  cartridges that remove ions remaining in the water following the filtration.  
  The quality of the water can be relatively easily measured via its resistivity.  
  The less able the water is to conduct electric current, the higher its purity.  
  The highest quality water achievable has a resistivity of around 18 M<span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Symbol;'>W</span><span lang=EN-US>-cm.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first high temperature process 
  in the fabrication of a solar cell is the diffusion into the top micron of the 
  wafer of a dopant such as phosphorous, which causes that layer to be negative 
  in polarity.  The wafer is coated with a layer of phosphorus containing material: 
  either a spin-on source of liquid that contains phosphorus or a thin layer of 
  phosphoric acid or phosphorus pentoxide is used.  To deposit phosphoric acid, 
  the wafers are usually placed onto a moving belt that transports the wafers 
  into a chamber where a mist of phosphoric acid is produced and allowed to deposit 
  onto the wafer surface.  The belt then transports the wafers into high temperature 
  regions of around 900 to 1,000 degrees Celsius, at which temperatures the phosphorus 
  penetrates into the top surface of the silicon wafer.  The higher the temperature 
  or the longer the time, the more phosphorus diffuses into the silicon.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Excess diffusion of phosphorous causes 
  damage to the silicon surface, which leads to an effective loss of any light 
  absorbed within such regions.  The shorter wavelengths of light that are absorbed 
  close to the surface are most effected.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Insufficient diffusion leaves the 
  silicon with poor electrical conductivity, causing high resistive losses within 
  the n-type silicon and potentially poor electrical contact to the metal that 
  is applied later in the fabrication sequence.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During diffusion, phosphorus penetrates 
  into the sides of the wafer, therefore providing unwanted conduction paths for 
  the generated electricity to the back surface.  This allows the positive polarity 
  metal contact to effectively short through to the negative polarity metal contact.  
  Current lost in this manner is often referred to as “edge leakage” current.  
  To remove the unwanted phosphorous diffused regions, the wafers are stacked 
  in a pile, often referred to as “coin stacking”, and then placed into a plasma 
  etching chamber.  In the chamber, a crude vacuum is formed, and etching gases 
  are allowed to flow into the chamber.  High voltages (either AC or DC) are applied 
  between electrodes within the vacuum chamber causing breakdown and electrical 
  discharge within the gas.  The ionic species produced react with and remove 
  the exposed silicon at the edge of the wafers.  Some damage can be created by 
  this plasma etching process as high energy ions and particles from the plasma 
  penetrate into the exposed silicon.  The top and bottom wafers in the coin stack 
  are normally protected by placing dummy wafers in the first and last locations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An anti-reflection coating (ARC) 
  can be optionally applied at this point in the manufacturing sequence or towards 
  the end of the sequence.  An ARC is a dielectric layer of precise thickness, 
  which requires a refractive index in the vicinity of 1.9-2.0 and is typically 
  made of silicon nitride or titanium dioxide.  Atmospheric pressure chemical 
  vapour deposition (APCVD) is often used to apply the ARC.  The wafers are transported 
  by a belt into a chamber, where titanium dioxide is deposited from vapour phase 
  onto the wafer surface.  The wafer is then heated to give the layer the required 
  optical, mechanical and chemical properties.   The reflection prior to encapsulation 
  of textured cells is typically only 12%, so performance gains through adding 
  an ARC often do not justify the increased costs.  Non-textured multicrystalline 
  wafers reflect more than 30% of light, making an ARC essential.  The ARC is 
  optimised to be most effective at reducing reflection for the dominant wavelengths 
  of sunlight which include green, yellow and red.  Consequently, it is mainly 
  blue light reflected, giving a blue appearance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Screen printed solar cells have their 
  metal contacts applied using screen printers.  For the back contact, aluminium 
  powder formed into a paste is forced by a squeegee through a screen onto the 
  rear surface of the wafer.  The screen may be a grid pattern or a solid pattern, 
  depending on the trade off between cost and performance.  The wafer is then 
  transferred via conveyor belts to a drying region in which the wafers are heated 
  to a few hundred degrees to dry the paste by removing the solvents.  Sometimes, 
  an additional screen printing step is used to apply solderable silver pads to 
  the aluminium paste regions, so solar cells can be interconnected via wires.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Following the drying step, the wafers 
  are transported via a belt into the high temperature region of an infrared belt 
  furnace.  The belt moves at a relatively high speed and the high temperature 
  zone is relatively short.  The wafer is exposed to temperatures in the range 
  of 700-900<span>°</span>C for a minute or so.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After firing the rear metal contact, 
  the wafers are transported to another screen printer for the application of 
  the front metal contact.  Silver paste is used almost universally.  Again, the 
  wafers are located beneath the screen with a squeegee used to force the silver 
  paste through a patterned screen onto the wafer surface.  Excess metal coverage 
  shades more of the cell surface while insufficient metal coverage leads to resistive 
  losses and greater challenges to collect the generated current.  The wafers 
  are again transported to a drying zone to dry the metal paste prior to another 
  high temperature zone.  In general, the silver paste requires firing temperatures 
  in the range of 700-800 degrees Celsius to enable it to penetrate through an 
  ARC and make good electrical and mechanical contact to the n-type silicon.  
  The aluminium paste benefits from higher temperatures, since aluminium can beneficially 
  form an alloy with the silicon.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In some implementations of screen 
  printed technology, manufacturers choose a compromise in the firing conditions 
  for the metal contacts to allow both the front and rear metal contacts to be 
  fired simultaneously.  After drying the aluminium paste, the wafers are flipped 
  over to apply the front surface silver paste, and both are fired together.  
  The firing conditions must favour the silver contact since the higher temperatures 
  preferred for the aluminium alloying process will drive the silver too deeply 
  into the silicon to make good contact to the n-type layer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the completion of the manufacturing 
  processes, it is necessary to accurately test and sort the solar cells using 
  a solar simulator in conjunction with a dummy electrical load and computerised 
  testing station.  The solar cells are normally sorted into one of about 12 categories 
  depending on their electrical performance.  Solar cells with quite similar electrical 
  characteristics are grouped together for interconnection and encapsulation into 
  modules.  Many manufacturers are employing automated cell handling and interconnection 
  equipment or even robots for module construction.</font></p>
