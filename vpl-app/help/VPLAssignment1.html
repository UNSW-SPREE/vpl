  1 (Saw Damage Removal Etch)</span></b></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Assignment 1 familiarises the user with the first process in manufacturing screen-printed 
  silicon solar cells. The wafers must be etched to remove the residual surface 
  damage </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">and contaminants that result from sawing the ingot into 
  wafers. The temperature, sodium hydroxide concentration of the etching solution, 
  and the time in the chemical bath may be specified by the user. All other processing 
  parameters for all other processes throughout the production line remain fixed 
  at the default values and therefore cannot be varied for this assignment.</font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The assignment 
  batch contains 10 wafers. You may process as many batches as you like while 
  trying to optimise the processing parameters of the &#147;saw damage removal 
  etch&#147;.  Your overall aim is to achieve the highest performance cells but 
  while simultaneously achieving good yields.  There are <b>help files</b> that 
  can be accessed to help you understand and learn about the significance of the 
  etching parameters and their optimisation.  There are also various tests you 
  can perform on finished and partially finished cells to help monitor performance 
  during processing. You may process multiple &#147;Assignment batches&#147;, in order to 
  achieve the best possible results.  You will submit the results from one batch 
  to satisfy task A and may submit the results from a separate batch to satisfy 
  the requirements of Task B.   Often in <span class=GramE>manufacturing</span>, 
  we find that the batch that produces the highest efficiency cell (as required 
  for task A, does not necessarily produce the highest average cell efficiency 
  for the whole batch (as required for task B).  Each task is worth 50% of the 
  marks, with the efficiencies achieved directly determining the marks awarded:</font></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;'>Task 
  A:</span></b><span>    </span>To produce an Assignment batch with the highest 
  efficiency single cell. The quality of the remainder of the cells does not matter.  
  (<span class=GramE>note</span>: The higher the efficiency the higher the mark)</font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;'>Task 
  B:</span></b><span>      </span>To produce an Assignment batch with the highest 
  average cell efficiency over the 10 cells. (Note that efficiency of broken cells 
  is 0).</font></p>
