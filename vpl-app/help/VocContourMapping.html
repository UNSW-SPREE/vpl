<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
  test is only useful following the firing of the aluminium rear metal contact 
  or else at the completion of processing if the front surface metal contact is 
  removed.  This is a particularly useful test to identify localised shunting 
  regions that may result from contamination such as small amounts of aluminium 
  paste being accidentally transferred to the front surface of the wafer. </font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
  test is simply performed by placing the wafer on a temperature controlled metal 
  block beneath a light source.  If the diffusion oxide or other layer remains 
  on the wafer surface, this will probably have to be removed prior to this test.  
  A multimeter can then be used to probe the voltage (open circuit voltage) formed 
  between the metal block and the other probe which is used to contact various 
  points on the wafer surface.  Without a front metal contact, the lateral resistance 
  is relatively high, therefore allowing localised shunted regions to be easily 
  identified.  Localised shunting causes the open circuit voltage in that immediate 
  vicinity to be dragged to a low value.  Adjacent regions feed current laterally 
  through the diffused emitter into this shunted region.  This provides a lateral 
  voltage change (Voc contour).  A typical measurement scenario would involve 
  probing the Voc roughly every centimetre or so across the entire wafer surface.  
  By following the Voc contours in the direction of the lower values, it becomes 
  possible to pinpoint the location where the shunting is occurring.  The Voc 
  at this point may fall by hundreds of millivolts.  As the Voc value is probed 
  in the adjacent regions, the Voc will then increase as the distance away from 
  the shunted point increases.  The gradient of these contours gives an indication 
  of the severity of the shunting although the main benefit of this test is that 
  it identifies the presence of a shunting problem and its location that in turn 
  gives insight into the cause of the problem.  Examples of typical contours are 
  shown below.</font></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If 
  this test is performed prior to edge junction isolation (through plasma etching), 
  some shunting around the edges of the wafer is normal as shown above.  The V<sub>oc</sub> 
  contour test will therefore indicate a reducing V<sub>oc</sub> value in close 
  proximity to the edges.  Without additional shunting, however, the V<sub>oc</sub> 
  value for all the central regions of the wafer should remain relatively uniform 
  and at a value similar to what the final device Voc should be after the completion 
  of processing.  The contour mapping below is typical of a wafer with a localised 
  shunting problem resulting from aluminium paste contaminating a small region 
  of the wafer surface.</font></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
  test can still be performed without a temperature-controlled block although 
  allowance will have to be made for the fact that the Voc at any point will fall 
  approximately 2.2mV for every degree increase in temperature.  The cell may 
  heat up during the test therefore necessitating repeated readings and some adjustment 
  of values.  However, the presence of the Voc contours should still be able to be easily identified.</font></p>
