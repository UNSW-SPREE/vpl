  6 (Edge Junction Isolation by Plasma Etching)</span></b></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Assignment 
  6 focuses on the removal of the phosphorus diffused region down the edges of 
  the wafer that cause shunting between the front and rear metal contacts.  These 
  diffused edges are normally removed by plasma etching with the primary processing 
  parameters being the plasma power and the duration of the etching process  (assuming 
  an appropriate gas and corresponding flow rate is maintained).  One problem 
  with plasma based processes is that the high energy ions tend to damage the 
  exposed silicon material which can be quite critical in this case due to the 
  junction potentially being exposed to the plasma.  All other processing parameters 
  for all other processes throughout the production line remain fixed at the default 
  values and therefore cannot be varied for this assignment.</font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The assignment 
  batch contains 10 wafers. You may process as many batches as you like while 
  trying to optimise the processing parameters for the &#147;plasma etching&#147;.  Your 
  overall aim is to achieve the highest performance cells but while simultaneously 
  achieving good yields.  There are <b>help files</b> that can be accessed to 
  help you understand and learn about the significance of these plasma etching 
  parameters and their optimisation.  There are also various tests you can perform 
  on finished and partially finished cells to help monitor performance during 
  processing. You may process multiple &#147;Assignment batches&#147;, in order to achieve 
  the best possible results.  You will submit the results from one batch to satisfy 
  Task A and may submit the results from separate batches to satisfy the requirements 
  of the other Tasks.  Each task is worth 25% of the marks, with the efficiencies/lifetimes 
  <span class=GramE>achieved</span> directly determining the marks awarded:</font></p>

style='font-size:11.0pt;'>Study Questions</span></b></font></p>
<p style='
'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. For the cell with the highest pseudo 
  efficiency, why does this not also have the highest open circuit voltage as 
  determined in Task B?</font></p>
<p style='
'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. Why is it that virtually the same 
  conditions of plasma etching are required to optimise both the pseudo efficiency 
  and the real cell efficiency (which is very unlike the cases for both Al firing 
  and phosphorus diffusion)?</font></p>
