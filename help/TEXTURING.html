    <td><span style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
  most common approach used to minimize the destruction of existing pyramids is 
  to add isopropanol to the texturing solution.&nbsp; The common belief is that carbon 
  precipitates in the texturing solution originating from the isopropanol adhere 
  to the silicon surface thereby preventing etching at that point.&nbsp; This nucleates 
  the growth of a pyramid whereby its apex is protected from being etched by the 
  presence of the carbon precipitate.&nbsp; Provided a high density of these precipitates 
  can be retained on the silicon surface for approximately 15-20 minutes, good 
  quality texturing can be achieved.&nbsp; Good quality refers to the uniformity of 
  the pyramid distribution, the achievement of pyramid dimensions in the range 
  of 3-8 microns (across the pyramid base), 100% coverage of the wafer surface

  perception that identically repeated processes can sometimes give drastically

  of parameters (many of which are not well understood) that can in fact have 
  a significant impact on the texturing process.  A couple of examples experienced 
  on production lines are as follows.</font></p>

  <tr>
    <td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
  one manufacturer&#146;s production facility, the commissioning of a new belt furnace 
  (typical of that shown) coincided with a severe deterioration in the texturing 
  quality.&nbsp; The observed change in the texturing was that considerable non-uniformity 
  in pyramid sizes resulted, with large numbers of very small pyramids in the 
  vicinity of 1-2 microns ranging right up to large numbers of more normally sized 
  pyramids in the range of 5-10 microns.&nbsp; The cause of the change was eventually 
  identified as resulting from the commissioning of the new exhaust system for 
  the new belt furnace which incidentally reduced the exhaust flow/ventilation 
  for the texturing bath.&nbsp; Restoration of the original ventilation air flows for 
  the texturing bath restored the texturing to its original high quality and uniformity 
  of pyramid size, thereby demonstrating the importance of this particular parameter.</font></td>

</table>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
  cause of the change is believed to relate to the evaporation rate of the isopropanol 
  from the texturing solution.  In the early stages of texturing, the isopropanol 
  is believed to be necessary to produce the precipitates on the wafer surface 
  that nucleate the pyramid growth.  Provided a reasonable density of pyramid 
  nucleation takes place, it is therefore not necessary for large numbers of new 
  pyramids to continually nucleate during the texturing process.  The high evaporation 
  rate for the isopropanol from the texturing solution helps reduce this generation 
  rate for the later stages of the texturing process.  In the example given, the 
  reduced air flow for ventilating the texturing bath that occurred when the new 
  belt furnace was commissioned appeared to cause a reduction in the evaporation 
  rate for the isopropanol therefore leading to larger volumes of isopropanol 
  remaining in the solution in the later stages of texturing.  This higher concentration 
  appears to therefore explain why relatively large numbers of small pyramids 
  continued to generate late in the texturing process, therefore leading to the 
  large non-uniformity in pyramid dimensions. </font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
  experience clearly demonstrates the important role of isopropanol.  Too much 
  isopropanol in the texturing solution causes too high a density of nucleation 
  for pyramids with a corresponding smaller than preferred dimension for the pyramids.  
  Insufficient propanol at the commencement of texturing leads to too low a density 
  of pyramid nucleation, with pyramids therefore needing to grow to much larger 
  dimensions over a longer period of time to give complete coverage of the wafer 
  surface.  For sequential batches of texturing, there will always be some residual 
  isopropanol from the preceding batch, with the replenishment volume being typically 
  reduced to approximately 4% for the second and subsequent batches.  </font></p>

    <td><p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
      above experience led to a study of the impact of variations in the ventilation 
      rate (a typical exhaust system is shown to the left).&nbsp; Insufficient evaporation 
      rate for the isopropanol led to the effect described above relating the non-uniform 
      pyramid sizes and distribution.&nbsp; Excessive evaporation rates led to too rapid 
      a depletion of the isopropanol concentration, leading to low density nucleation 
      of pyramids.&nbsp; This can be compensated for by increased isopropanol concentration 
      prior to immersing the cassettes of wafers although this has other side effects 
      of making the solution too turbulent with the consequence that precipitates 
      can then be dislodged from the pyramid apexes during texturing, therefore leading 
      to their destruction.&nbsp; Once an appropriate ventilation rate has been established, 
      the main challenge is to retain repeatability in the procedures which include 
      adding the right volume of isopropanol, always placing the cassettes of wafers 
      in the solution&nbsp; the same length of time after adding the isopropanol, maintaining 
      the right texturing bath temperature (that also has significant impact on the 
      isopropanol evaporation rate), keeping the ventilation rate for texturing bath 
      constant throughout the texturing and from batch to batch, and finally ensuring 
      the lid of the texturing bath is replaced in an identical fashion for each batch.&nbsp;</font></p>

lang=EN-US>Example 2</span></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another 
  experience from a production line was when the damage removal etch solution 
  was disposed of and replaced by a fresh 30% sodium hydroxide solution without 
  any sodium silicate.  With apparently nothing else changing, the pyramid density 
  during texturing dropped quite markedly with the corresponding pyramid size 
  rising to typically 15 microns.  Even with these larger pyramids, the nucleation 
  density was too low such that after the standard texturing period, approximately 
  30% of the wafer surface remained flat and untextured.  The role of the sodium 
  silicate in the damage removal etch is discussed in the section relating to 
  the saw damage removal etch.  Ideally, this etch produces a roughened surface 
  that appears conducive to enhancing the rate at which precipitates stick to 
  the wafer surface to nucleate subsequent pyramid growth.  The other important 
  factor seems to be that the rougher surface also makes it more difficult for 
  the precipitates to be dislodged during the subsequent texturing, therefore 
  minimizing the number of pyramids destroyed during the actual texturing process.  
  Again, other texturing parameters can be varied to compensate for the undesirable 
  wafer surface following the saw damage removal etch.  For instance, the duration 
  of texturing can be increased to facilitate increased coverage of the wafer 
  surface by pyramids.  An adverse effect of this compensation, however, is that 
  pyramids needs to grow as large as up to 20 microns in size, which in turn necessitates 
  the precipitates at the apex surviving for much longer periods of time.  Many 
  pyramids may not survive the increased duration and will consequently be destroyed.  
  Also, the larger pyramid size can cause problems with subsequent screen printing, 
  antireflection coating deposition and even increase dislocation generation from 
  the pyramid peaks and bases, with propagation into the base.  Other parameters 
  that can be varied to minimize the impact of the changed saw damage removal 
  etch include increasing the isopropanol concentration to increase the pyramid 
  nucleation density, or even slightly reducing the ventilation rate for the solution 
  so as to facilitate increased pyramid nucleation during the texturing process 
  to compensate for the lower initial nucleation density.  </font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span
lang=EN-US>Adjustment of these parameters to compensate for the poorer initial 
  nucleation density all give non-optimal outcomes compared to fixing the problem

lang=EN-US>Example 3</span></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
  third example of an obscure change to the texturing solution was when one manufacturer 
  simply changed to a different supplier of the isopropanol.  The specification 
  sheets for the &#147;transistor grade&#147; isopropanol were identical and yet the two 
  sources behaved quite differently in the texturing bath.  The difference is 
  still not well understood although this phenomenon has necessitated improved 
  in-line quality control whereby all new batches of isopropanol are tested in 
  parallel with preceding batches of isopropanol that are of known quality and 
  known to work as required in the corresponding processes.  Good isopropanol 
  stocks are consequently always held in reserve for occasions when problems exist 
  with new suppliers. </font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span
lang=EN-US>Example 4</span></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
  fourth example relates to when a new operator poured the chemicals into the 
  texturing bath in a somewhat different fashion to normal.  One problem related 
  to pouring the isopropanol at a different rate, therefore causing changes both 
  to the evaporation rate and the solution turbulance.  The second problem related 
  to pouring the liquid sodium hydroxide into the deionized water without stirring 
  when establishing the texturing solution.  This allowed the higher density concentrated 
  sodium hydroxide to settle in the bottom of the bath, therefore causing a concentration 
  gradient as well as a temperature gradient in a similar manner as to occurs 
  with solar ponds as is described in the section on the saw damage removal etch.  
  </font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With 
  regard to adding the propanol to the texturing bath, caution is advised as the 
  texturing bath temperature is higher than the boiling point of the isopropanol.  
  The isopropanol should therefore be poured slowly into the texturing bath over 
  a period of approximately 30 seconds.  The isopropanol is also less dense than 
  the dilute sodium hydroxide leading to a significant proportion of the isopropanol 
  residing near the surface of the texturing solution.  For this reason, the texturing 
  baths should be designed so as to facilitate a depth of solution significantly 
  greater than the width of the wafers to ensure that the highest point of the 
  silicon wafer is submerged at least 3 cm below the texturing bath surface.  
  Failure to observe this design constraint will lead to a region of the silicon 
  wafer being exposed to much higher turbulence and much higher isopropanol concentrations 
  with corresponding negative impacts on the quality of the resulting texturing.

    <td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Advanced 
  texturing techniques have been developed over the last decade that reduce the 
  importance and dependence on many of the key parameters such as isopropanol 
  concentration, ventilation rate, surface finish following the saw damage removal 
  etch, and critical periods of timing such as delays between batches or the delay 
  between isopropanol addition and the immersion of the cassettes of silicon wafers.&nbsp; 
  The important ingredient is again sodium silicate that forms naturally during 
  the texturing process as the sodium hydroxide reacts with the silicon.&nbsp; However, 
  approximately 20 batches of silicon wafers need to be textured before sufficient 
  sodium silicate is produced to have a positive impact upon the texturing process.&nbsp;</font></td>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It is still not well understood what role the sodium silicate plays, but one 
  possibility is that the increased solution viscosity reduces solution turbulence, 
  therefore facilitating better pyramid nucleation and improved precipitate survival 
  during texturing while necessitating less isopropanol.&nbsp; Although the role of 
  the sodium silicate is not well understood, it has been observed that reasonable 
  quantities of boron have also been found to aid the texturing process.  </font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another 
  theory is that the sodium silicate itself provides another source of precipitates 
  that settle on the silicon wafer surface to nucleate pyramid growth.  Even if 
  this is the case, a small quantity of isopropanol is nevertheless required in 
  the texturing solution but with replenishment rates between batches of only 
  typically 1% rather than the more normally expected 4-5%.  </font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
  isopropanol also appears to perform an invaluable &#147;wetting&#147; function for 
  the wafer surface that facilitates a uniform and reliable evolution of hydrogen 
  gas bubbles from the surface so as to allow the texturing to proceed uniformly 
  and reliably.  Insufficient propanol even in this regime of texturing will lead 
  to the gas bubbles apparently sticking to the surface until growing to quite 
  large dimensions in the vicinity of many millimetres in diameter.  These growing 
  gas bubbles at the surface prevent access of the texturing solution to the silicon 
  surface, therefore damaging the corresponding regions of texturing.  </font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
  much lower dependence on propanol in this texturing regime therefore removes 
  the sensitivity of the texturing quality to the ventilation rate.  Much lower 
  ventilation rates can be tolerated with much smaller volumes of propanol requiring 
  evaporation during the texturing process.  These texturing solutions also perform 
  far more reliably and consistently with a wide range of surface finishes following 
  the saw damage etch.  These solutions even work well with wafers with highly 
  polished mirror surfaces produced through mechanical polishing.  The main challenge 
  is to initially get these solutions working as required as there is no simple 
  recipe to follow when initially forming the solution.  A good approach for high 
  volume production has been to form a new solution by disposing of half of the 
  old solution that is to be discarded because of excessive accumulation of sodium 
  silicate.  Half of the old solution is then combined with an equivalent volume 
  of 2% sodium hydroxide with approximately 4% isopropanol concentration (2% when 
  measured relative to the full volume of the new solution).  While &#147;tuning in&#147; 
  the new texturing bath, a couple of dummy wafers are sufficient for evaluation 
  purposes.  The only real variable that needs to be adjusted is the isopropanol 
  concentration.  If the solution contains insufficient isopropanol, the pyramids 
  will be larger in size and there will be a tendency for the pyramid bases to 
  be over-etched to form actual grooves.  At the other extreme, excessive volumes 
  of isopropanol will cause greater non-uniformity in pyramid sizes, often with 
  large clumps of very small pyramids.  There may also be evidence of pyramids 
  being destroyed through the nulceation of new pyramids onto the side faces of 
  existing pyramids.  </font></p>

    <td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Between 
  batches, some replenishment of sodium hydroxide will also be necessary if large 
  numbers of batches (such as shown to the left) are to be textured.&nbsp; The volume 
  required for replenishment can be relatively easily calculated by measuring 
  the amount of silicon removed during the texturing for each wafer, and multiplying 
  this by the number of wafers being textured.&nbsp; From this total volume of silicon 
  removed, the quantity of sodium hydroxide consumed can be relatively easily 
  calculated.&nbsp; The only trap in this calculation is that the wafer thickness for 
  the textured wafer will be measured between pyramid peaks with allowance having 
  to be made for the silicon also removed between the pyramid peaks and the pyramid 
  bases.</font></td>

<p style='text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Another indicator as to whether the right amount of isopropanol is being 
  replenished between each batch is to observe the density of dots formed on the 
  wafer surface by hydrogen gas bubbles sticking to the surface during texturing.  
  These dots will normally cover approximately a couple of percent of the wafer 
  surface with higher coverage indicating the need for additional propanol, while 
  reduced coverage by these dots  indicates that reduced volumes of propanol replenishment 
  can be tolerated.</font></p>

      key advantage of this type of texturing regime is that it is far less dependent 
      on the number of wafers being textured and their type.&nbsp; In these solutions,

        further caution with this type of texturing is the tendency for residues of 
        sodium silicate to remain on the wafer surface following the completion of texturing.&nbsp; 
        It is essential that a well ventilated hydrofluoric (HF) acid bath (such as 
        shown to the right) be used following a deionized rinse to ensure that this 
        sodium silicate is thoroughly removed.&nbsp; Extreme care must be exercised when
