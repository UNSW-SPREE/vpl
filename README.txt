INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
Run 'VPL Setup.exe', which will launch an installer for the Virtual Production Line.

Install the Virtual Production Line into a directory where the user will have Read and Write access during use of the application. In VISTA, you MUST NOT install in the C:\Program Files directory. Choose a directory with user read/write access instead.

The Virtual Production Line installer will launch a second installer for the Java Media Framework, which is required to run the Virtual Production Line. Do not restart your computer at the conclusion of installation of the Java Media Framework installation. Wait until the Virtual Production Line installation is complete.
?
TO UNINSTALL:
Run 'Uninstall.exe' from the Virtual Production Line programme directory. If you this is unsuccessful, simply delete the Virtual Production Line directory.
?
?
TO OPERATE THE VIRTUAL PRODUCTION LINE:
Create a new batch of cells and specify the type of silicon wafers required.
?
Processes for manufacturing solar cells will become available in one of two specific sequences, the first consisting of separate firing, and the second of co-firing of the front and back metal contacts. Texturing of the wafers and the application of an anti-reflection coating are also optional. 
?
For each process, adjust the processing parameters on the right hand panel as desired and then press the button to run the process. A video of the process will play. The processing parameters for the next process will then be displayed.
?
Tests may be run on the cells in the batch at any time from the Tools menu. Different tests become available at different points in the processing sequence. Some of the tests return a graph. To view the graph, press the button labelled 'Show Graph...'. To return to the process control panel, press the same button, which will now be labelled 'Graph Showing'. 
?
The user may specify preferred settings for each process via the Settings menu. Last used, preferred or default settings may be used for processing.
?
To export batch data (including graph data) as a text file, press 'Export Batch' on the main toolbar. 
?
?
Minimum Requirements:
Pentium II or higher,
128M RAM,
300-400MB free space on hard drive.

?
You may use the software on systems with less RAM and processor capability, but crashes due to out of memory errors may occur while playing video.
?
This version tested on Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Vista.
?
?
KNOWN BUGS:
- �Ohm?symbols and �square?symbols in exported text files appear as ??
- Exported text file gives Voc test results as follows: upper and lower limits for Voc, and if a damaged region exists, a third value is given for the localised damaged region.?Units are mV.
- When the VPL runs PC1D calculations, the screen will flicker & the menu from PC1D for windows will be partially visible.?If you are processing 100 cells, the flickering will go on for a minute or two.
